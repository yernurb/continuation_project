abstract = {A statistical model of fragmentation of aggregates is proposed, based on the stochastic propagation of cracks through the body. The propagation rules are formulated on a lattice and mimic two important features of the process -- a crack moves against the stress gradient and its energy depletes as it grows. We perform numerical simulations of the model for two-dimensional lattice and reveal that the mass distribution for small and intermediate-size fragments obeys a power-law, F(m)\propto m^(-3/2), in agreement with experimental observations. We develop an analytical theory which explains the detected power-law and demonstrate that the overall fragment mass distribution in our model agrees qualitatively with that, observed in experiments.},

@article{Brilliantov2013,
abstract = {Saturn's rings consist of a huge number of water ice particles, with a tiny addition of rocky material. They form a flat disk, as the result of an interplay of angular momentum conservation and the steady loss of energy in dissipative inter-particle collisions. For particles in the size range from a few centimeters to a few meters, a power-law distribution of radii, $\sim r^{-q}$ with $q \approx 3$, has been inferred; for larger sizes, the distribution has a steep cutoff. It has been suggested that this size distribution may arise from a balance between aggregation and fragmentation of ring particles, yet neither the power-law dependence nor the upper size cutoff have been established on theoretical grounds. Here we propose a model for the particle size distribution that quantitatively explains the observations. In accordance with data, our model predicts the exponent $q$ to be constrained to the interval $2.75 \le q \le 3.5$. Also an exponential cutoff for larger particle sizes establishes naturally with the cutoff-radius being set by the relative frequency of aggregating and disruptive collisions. This cutoff is much smaller than the typical scale of micro-structures seen in Saturn's rings.},
