  ABSTRACT      = {
Protostellar and protoplanetary systems, as well as merging galactic
nuclei, often interact tidally and resonantly with the astrophysical
disks via gravity. Underlying our understanding of the formation
processes of stars, planets, and some galaxies is a dynamical theory of
such interactions. Its main goals are to determine the geometry of the
binary-disk system and, through the torque calculations, the rate of
change of orbital elements of the components. We present some recent
developments in this field concentrating on eccentricity driving
mechanisms in protoplanetary and protobinary systems. In those two types
of systems the result of the interaction is opposite. A small body
embedded in a disk suffers a decrease of orbital eccentricity, whereas
newly formed binary stars surrounded by protostellar disks may undergo a
significant orbital evolution increasing their eccentricities. },

  ABSTRACT      = {
The electric and magnetic fields associated with the solar wind prevent
interstellar submicron dust from reaching the neighborhood of the earth,
primarily because the charged dust grains have large gyroradii and move
down the electric field. During passage through an interstellar cloud, the
degree of heliosphere contraction (solar wind restriction) depends on the
helium gas component, as accelerated in the sun's gravitational field. For
cloud densities exceeding 100/cu cm, the dust component reaches the earth
with little depletion, at least on the upstream part of the earth's orbit.
Formulas are developed for grain densities in the sun's gravitationally
focused wake, as limited by the electromagnetic scattering. Since this is
a sensitive function of grain size, space-borne detectors that
discriminate sizes in the 1-10-micron region would test the theory and
establish interstellar dust parameters.},

abstract = {A hydrodynamic description for an s -component mixture of inelastic, smooth hard disks (two dimensions) or spheres (three dimensions) is derived based on the revised Enskog theory for the single-particle velocity distribution functions. In this first part of the two-part series, the macroscopic balance equations for mass, momentum, and energy are derived. Constitutive equations are calculated from exact expressions for the fluxes by a Chapman-Enskog expansion carried out to first order in spatial gradients, thereby resulting in a Navier-Stokes order theory. Within this context of small gradients, the theory is applicable to a wide range of restitution coefficients and densities. The resulting integral-differential equations for the zeroth- and first-order approximations of the distribution functions are given in exact form. An approximate solution to these equations is required for practical purposes in order to cast the constitutive quantities as algebraic functions of the macroscopic variables; this task is described in the companion paper. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
It is pointed out that the spatial distribution of interplanetary
dust grains is closely connected to the origin of the grains and to
their dynamical behavior in interplanetary space. A reasonable
distribution function for grain orbits would provide a basis for
obtaining the spatial distribution of grains with the aid of the
integral considered by Haug (1958). One of the attempts to estimate
the orbital distribution of grains involves the solution of a
Fokker-Planck equation in phase space. Briggs (1962) proceeded to
calculate the spatial distribution of grains, taking into account an
analytical solution of the equation for the secular changes in
orbital elements of a grain exclusively due to the Poynting-Robertson
effect. The present investigation is concerned with the
generalization of Brigg's method with the aim to obtain a realistic
distribution function of grain orbits. The obtained results are
compared with the spatial distribution derived by Leinert et al.
(1981) based on the zodiacal light experiments from the Helios
probes.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The in situ dust detectors on board the Helios spaceprobes detected
impacts of micrometeoroids between 0.3 AU and 1 AU distance from the
sun. Among the measured quantities were mass, impact speed and flight
direction of the dust particles. Radial variations of the flux,
azimuthal distribution, and impact speed are discussed. Significantly
different results were obtained for the 'apex' particles observed by
both ecliptic and south sensors and for the 'eccentric' particles
detected only by the south sensor. The radial spatial density
variation of the 'eccentric' particles is compatible with that
derived for zodiacal light particles. Whereas the spatial density for
'apex' particles peaks at 0.5 to 0.6 AU. From the measured quantities
probability distributions of orbital elements were derived for the
observed micrometeoroids. About 60 percent of the observed
micrometeroids ('apex' particles) are on low energy orbits (a less
than about 0.6 AU). About 30 percent of the particles ('eccentric'
particles) had high energy orbits (a greater than about 0.9 AU). More
than 10 percent of the observed particles show high probabilities for
travelling on hyperbolic orbits.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Several unsolved problems in the evolutionary histories leading to
current dynamical configurations of the planets and their systems of
satellites are discussed. These include the possibilities of rather
tight constraints on the primordial rotation states of Mercury and
Venus and the stabilizing mechanism for the latter's retrograde spin,
a brief mention of the problem of origin of the moons of earth and
Mars, the excessive heat flow from Jupiter's satellite Io which is
not compatible with an otherwise self-consistent model of origin of
the Laplace three-body libration, the mechanism for the long history
of resurfacing of Saturn's satellite Enceladus and the possibly short
lifetime of the A ring and the mechanisms for resurfacing the
satellites of Uranus, especially Ariel, if the high stability of the
mean motion orbital resonances at the 2/1 commensurability involving
Ariel and Umbriel precludes a long term occupancy of the resonance.
Finally, excessive times of accumulation of the outer planets in
current models may possibly be reducible from the effects of nebular
gas drag.}

  ABSTRACT      = {
The problem of the collisional production of beta meteoroids is
reexamined by incorporating the experimental results of Fugiwara et al.
(1977). The collisional model yields a flux of fragments supported by
the conservation of mass flux, which does not account by far for the
observed flux of submicron grains. Particles larger than approximately
100 microns will be destroyed by collisions inside 1 AU, well before
they get near the sun. The existence of two independent populations of
interplanetary dust grains as proposed by Le Sergeant and Lamy (1978,
1980) appears to be reinforced. In addition, it is suggested that the
bulk of submicron grains does not necessary travel in hyperbolic orbits
and that beta meteoroids may be a transitory phenomenon of limited
importance.},

The rings encircling the planet Uranus, which were discovered by
Elliot et al. (1977), are compared with the rings of Saturn. In the
case of Uranus the rings are exceedingly narrow. It is pointed out
that resonances with satellites would provide the explanation for the
presence of orbiting material in such narrow lanes. The proposed
theory is considered in terms of celestial mechanics. The products of
satellite masses are presented in a table. It appears that the
combinations of Ariel and Titania and of Ariel and Oberon would
dominate.},

The structure of the electromagnetic and particulate characteristics

these characteristics is discussed. Electromagnetic effects on
hyperbolic particle orbits are examined, and the properties of the
zodiacal dust cloud which may be explained by electromagnetic
interactions are addressed. Stochastic perturbations of the
interplanetary dust are discussed. It is concluded that submicron
particles can be highly modulated by the solar cycle, and cannot be
expected to follow the neutral gas trajectories. A kind of trapping
of these particles occurs at inclinations below about 15 deg.
Stochastic spreading in particle inclinations in the low latitude
'sectored' field regime is unimportant for particles larger than
about 10 microns. Stochastic orbit perturbations for high inclination
particles, caused by solar cycle variations, is more important,
affecting particles up to about 10 microns.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Monte Carlo-based computer calculations, as well as analytical approaches
utilizing probabilistic arguments, were applied to gain insight into the
principal regolith impact processes and their resulting kinetics. Craters
10 to 1500 m in diameter are largely responsible for the overall growth of
the regolith. As a consequence the regolith has to be envisioned as a
complex sequence of discrete ejecta blankets. Such blankets constitute
first-order discontinuities in the evolving debris layer. The
micrometeoroid complex then operates intensely on these fresh ejecta
blankets and accomplishes only in an uppermost layer of approximately 1-mm
thickness. The absolute flux of micrometeoroids based on lunar rock
analyses averaged over the past few 10 to the 6th power years is
approximately an order of magnitude lower than presentday satellite
fluxes; however, there is indication that the flux increased in the past
10 to the 4th power years to become compatible with the satellite data.
Furthermore, there is detailed evidence that the micrometeoroid complex
existed throughout geologic time.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
It is demonstrated that the Kirkwood gaps are not merely regions of
low asteroidal number density, but are regions in a-e-sin 1/2 I space
where libration of some argument is possible. It is argued that
neither the statistical nor the cosmogonic hypothesis of gap
formation can account for these new observations. It is shown that
the present distribution of asteroidal semimajor axes can be used to
deduce the present semimajor axis of Jupiter to an accuracy of one
part in five thousand. Thus, there has been very little change in the
orbital period of Jupiter since the time of formation of the present
gaps. This observation eliminates the possibility that the observed
gaps were formed by resonance sweeping at the time of the dispersal
of the accretion disk. It is concluded that the gaps have been formed
by the gravitational action of Jupiter on individual asteroids and
that gap formation has probably continued throughout the lifetime of
the solar system.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Experimental results are reported for a study of micrometeorites that was
conducted using spacecraft near earth and in the vicinity of the moon. It
is found that the flux of meteoric particles at a distance of about 200 km
from earth's surface is roughly 1-1/2 orders of magnitude greater than
near the moon and in interplanetary space. This near-earth excess is
interpreted as a circumterrestrial dust shell with a mass of approximately
140 kg and a thickness of up to 100 km. A logarithmic expression for the
integral mass distribution of the meteoric bodies is derived from the set
of experimental data. The material balance of the circumterrestrial dust
shell is computed on the assumption that interplanetary particles are
captured into earth orbit via aerodynamic drag in the upper layers of the
atmosphere.},

detects and measures particles in space by sensing the sunlight

to that on Pioneer 10, with some minor modifications. Reduction of
the Pioneer 11 data was complicated by the failure of one of the four
sensor channels at about 1.1 AU from the sun. Detailed analysis
yielded 51 events between 1.0 and 3.5 AU, which were used to
determine the particle concentration distribution in that region of
space. Weighted curve-fitting of the results shows agreement with the
concentrations derived from Pioneer 10 to within about a factor of
two. As with the Pioneer 10 results, the exponent of the size
dependency varies from about -1.7 for 100-micron radius particles to
about -3.2 for 10-cm bodies. The instrument, its operation, and the
method of data analysis are reviewed.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Fine fragments ejected with very high velocity immediately after a
high-velocity impact are one of the most important constituents of the
material observed as a result of impact phenomena. Drawbacks regarding the
employment of a high-speed camera in the study of the kinematics of fine
fragments are related to the image resolution which is not good enough to
reveal the properties of individual particles. In the reported study,
alternative methods were used. In the experiments, spherical nylon
projectiles with a diameter of 7 mm were fired at the target by making use
of a two-stage light-gas gun facility. Cubic basaltic rock targets of a
density of 2660 kg/(cu m) were employed. The grain sizes of the constituent
minerals in the target rock were in the range from 30 to 300 microns.
Attention is given to the *size spectra* of the fine fragments, the
distributions of microcrater diameters on secondary targets, energy
partitioning, and the injection angles for the high-velocity fine fragments.

  ABSTRACT      = {
Many different interactions have been proposed among the
magnetospheric particles, fields, and dust grains in the rings of the
outer planets. Attention is presently given to the energetic particle
absorption signatures obtained by Pioneer 11 and Voyagers 1 and 2,
which trace the mass concentrations of particulates in the
magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. Particulates immersed in the
magnetospheric plasma and exposed to solar UV radiation will charge
up to a surface potential that depends on the density and electron
energy of the plasma, as well as on the concentration of dust
particles. Kinetic effects of charged dust particles arise from the
interaction with the planetary magnetic field. Electromagnetic
effects are noted which lead to the halo of Jupiter's ring, the dust
distribution in Saturn's E ring, and the levitated dust in the Saturn
B ring spokes.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The numerous dust bands discovered by Voyager 2 at Uranus have
lifetimes on the order of 100 years against orbital decay by
exospheric drag. A system of low optical depth rings of 10 meter to 1
km sized bodies (moonlet belts) are proposed as continuing sources of
the dust particles. The ring system is modeled as a Markov Chain
consisting of states through which dust particle evolve with time.
Physical processes included in the model are orbit decay by
exospheric drag and Poynting-Robertson light drag; destruction of
grains by meteoroid impact; transport of dust through the classical
rings and moonlet belts; creation of dust particles from meteoroid
impacts onto rings, moons, and moonlet belts; liberation of regolith
material through ring and moonlet belt particle collisions; and
sweepup of ejecta by ring and moonlet belt particles. The optical
depth profiles for the main rings from Voyager 2 Photopolarimeter
Subsystem (PPS) occultation observation are used in modeling the
transport of dust through the rings. Simulations of the Uranus ring
system show that this model reproduces the observed characteristics
of the Uranus dust rings. The moonlet belt model is applied to the
rings of Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune, and is capable of reproducing
some of the observed characteristics of those ring systems. The
moonlet belt objects fit on a collisionally derived power-law size
distribution with the other components of the ring moon systems.
Since the rings and moonlet belts have lifetimes due to viscous
spreading less than the age of the solar system, a net model of
planetary rings emerges in which the rings are continually created
from the disruption of small satellites by meteoroid bombardment.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Evidence is adduced for several episodes of geologic resurfacing and
extensional tectonism spreading over much of the history of the
small, icy Saturn moon Enceladus. Resurfacing was the product of
fresh material eruptions that may have contained ammonia, which may
also have made melting in the interior more likely. Tidal dissipation
seems to be the only heating mechanism capable of melting Enceladus.
For the thermal properties of pure H2O, the orbital eccentricity
would have to be higher than the present value of 0.0044 by a factor
of 5-7 in order to maintain a molten interior, and may have to be
greater by a factor of 20 in order to cause melting in an initially
frozen body. Removal of eccentricity forcing would result in rapid
eccentricity damping, freezing, and the cessation of tectonic
activity.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
A survey using data from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) of
previously known B and A shell stars with IRAS detections has resulted
in the identification of three stars, HD 93563, Sigma Her, and 51 Oph,
which have spectral signatures of infalling circumstellar plasma similar
to Beta Pic. Two of these systems have infrared flux distributions
indicating the presence of circumstellar dust disks, while the other, HD
93563, has an infrared excess consistent with free-free emission from
the plasma envelope. With the identification of three such systems, it
is clear that infalling circumstellar plasma is more common than
previously anticipated among late-type B shell stars. The absence of
dust in one system, HD 93563, suggests that infalling plasma in these
stars, and possibly also in Beta Pic itself, may not be due to either
erosion of a dust disk or to high cometary bombardment rates, but may
instead be linked to stellar activity. },

  ABSTRACT      = {
Large-format IR array detectors are employed to map the solar corona out
to large angular distances from the sun during the 1991 eclipse, and the
images are used to confirm the absence of a circumsolar dust ring. An
HgCdTe-array detector is employed with broadband H, J, and K filters to
study wavelengths of 1-2.5 microns. An inhomogeneous structure in the
K-corona is noted in the images of the H- and K-band surface
brightnesses, and elliptical flattening of the F-corona is cnfirmed. The
2D IR observations are argued to provide unambiguous evidence that no
circumstellar dust ring existed during the time of observation. The
dynamics of the interplanetary dust particles are theorized to be the
product of influences other than or in addition to those described by
gravitational-radiation drag calculations. The results suggest that
previous detections of dust rings do not necessarily reflect the
existence of 'local' coronal dust rings.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
  We discuss the effects of taking into account the Earth's polar
flattening when modelling the solar radiation force which perturbs the orbit
of Earth satellites during their penumbra transitions. For this purpose, we
generalize our previous theory for these perturbations (Vokrouhlicky et al.
1993b), which assumed a spherical Earth. The new theory is then applied to
two satellites for which the penumbra perturbations may produce detectable
effects. The main changes with respect to the case with a spherical Earth
appear in the timing of the transition phases leading from sunlight to
shadow and vice versa, and in the overall duration of the eclipse intervals.
These changes can cause short-periodic dynamical effects, and might be
directly observable through in situ microaccelerometric measurements with
good time resolution. On the other hand, we show that no additional
long-term orbital effect on LAGEOS-type satellites is expected as a
consequence of the Earth's polar flattening, owing to a symmetry in the
shadow entry/exit phases, which causes the perturbations to average out
along one satellite revolution.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Tidal forces are seen as providing the best explanation for the
observed acceleration of Phobos. An integration backward in time is
carried out in investigating the orbital history of Phobos. The
integration uses the Laplace plane as a reference plane, and
dissipation within both the planet Mars and its satellite Phobos is
included. Figures are included showing the orbital elements of Phobos
in the past. A comparison of the curves for different values of the
dissipation within Phobos reveals the role played by the satellite's
tide, which significantly decreases the time scale as soon as the
eccentricity reaches an appreciable value. Depending on the magnitude
of this dissipation, the eccentricity could have been close to unity
some billions of years ago, a condition which favors capture as an
explanation for the satellite's origin. The variation of the
inclination shows a simple pattern. The weak dissipation within
Phobos, it is noted, implies a stability of the orbital plane over
the age of the solar system. The tidal evolution of the satellites is
seen as precluding capture of these bodies by Mars.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The Ulysses mission detected quasi-periodic streams of high-velocity
submicron-sized dust particles during its encounter with Jupiter. It
is shown here how the dust events could result from the acceleration
and subsequent ejection of small grains by Jupiter's magnetosphere.
Dust grains entering the plasma environment of the magnetosphere
become charged, with the result that their motion is then determined
by both electromagnetic and gravitational forces. This process is
modeled, and it is found that only those particles in a certain size
range gain sufficient energy to escape the Jovian system. Moreover,
if Io is assumed to be the source of the dust grains, its location in
geographic and geomagnetic coordinates determines the exit direction
of the escaping particles, providing a possible explanation for the
observed periodicities. The calculated mass and velocity range of the
escaping dust gains are consistent with the Ulysses findings.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The structure of Jupiter's rings was studied in an effort to
understand the processes that generate the rings.  The faint material
in the Saturn system was investigated leading to the discovery of a
new ring and a way to interpret the wavy features surrounding Encke's
division in terms of perturbing moonlets. The interaction of faint
rings and magnetospheres helped identify some of the charged particle
absorbers seen by Pioneer 11 in the neighborhood of the F ring.
Angular momentum drain might account for the slow rotations of
intermediate sized asteroids. Much of the Jovian ring structure can
be understood in terms of debris loss from satellites, rapid orbital
evolution, resonance, and charged dust dynamics.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The cosmic dust detector (called DUST) on the Ulysses
spacecraft has been sensing, since launch, cosmic dust
impacts both in and out of the ecliptic.  The rate at which
impacts are detected is highly variable, but is of the order
of one per day.  DUST measures the impact mass and speed as
well as the approximate direction from which each grain
arrives. In addition to interplanetary dust, the DUST
experiment has identified a monodirectional interstellar
dust population traversing the solar system and, near
Jupiter, "monthly" bursts of dust emanating from the Jovian
system. These latter bursts, or streams, of dust, along with
the associated grain charges and masses, and their
interactions with the solar wind magnetic field, constitute
the topic of this paper.},

On the Earth's Moon, obvious hazards to humans and machines are created by
extreme temperature fluctuations, low gravity, and the virtual absence of
any atmosphere. The most important other environmental factor is ionizing
radiation. Less obvious environmental hazards that must be considered
before establishing a manned presence on the lunar surface are the hazards
from micrometeoroid bombardment, the nuisance of
electro-statically-charged lunar dust, and an alien visual environment
without familiar clues. Before man can establish lunar bases and lunar
mining operations, and continue the exploration of that planet, we must
develop a means of mitigating these hazards.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Various processes can erode the surfaces of planetary ring particles.
Recent estimates for Saturn's rings suggest that a centimeter-thick
surface layer could be eroded from an isolated ring particle in less
than 1000 yr by meteoroid impacts alone. The atoms, molecules, and
chips ejected from ring particles by erosion will arc across the
rings along elliptical orbits. For moderate ring optical depths,
ejecta will be absorbed or inelastically scattered upon
reintersecting the ring plane. Continuous exchange of ejecta between
different ring regions can lead to net radial transport of mass and
angular momentum, to changes in particle sizes, and to the buildup of
chip regoliths several centimeters deep on the surfaces of ring
particles. Because most of the erosional ejecta are not lost but
merely exchanged over short distances, the net erosion rate of the
surfaces of these ring particles will be much less than that
estimated for an isolated particle. Numerical solutions for
time-dependent ballistic transport under various assumptions suggest
pile-up and spillover effects especially near regions of preexisting
high optical depth contrast, such as the inner edges of A and B
rings. Global redistribution could be significant over billions of
years. Other features in planetary ring systems may be influenced by
ballistic transport.},

    ABSTRACT     = {
There is a possible connection between structure in circumstellar dust
clouds and the presence of planets, our own zodiacal cloud being the
prime example. Asymmetries in such clouds could be diagnostic of planets
which would be otherwise undetectable. One such feature is an offset of
the center of symmetry of the disk with respect to the central star. The
offset is caused by the forced eccentricities (e(sub f)) of particles in
the cloud. The orbit of a particle can be described by a set of five
orbital elements: the semi-major axis (a), eccentricity (e), inclination
(I), longitude of ascending node (Omega) and the argument of pericenter
(omega). In low order secular perturbation theory, osculating elements
of small bodies are decomposed into proper and forced elements. The
proper elements are dependent on initial conditions while the forced
elements are imposed on the particle's orbit by the gravitational
perturbations of the planets. This decomposition is still applicable in
the presence of drag forces. We compare COBE observations of the
variation in average polar brightness of the background cloud, (N +
S)/2, with ecliptic longitude of Earth with those of a model cloud made
of asteroidal particles which populate the inner solar system according
to a 1/r(exp gamma) where (gamma) = 1 (Poynting Robertson light drag)
distribution. The variation with ecliptic longitude of Earth in mean
polar brightness is shown in for the 25 micron waveband. Sine curves are
fit to both the COBE observations and the model. The variation in
(N+S)/2 with ecliptic longitude of Earth can be represented as a
superposition of two sine curves: one for the variation in (N + S)/2 due
to the Earth's eccentric orbit and the other for the variation in (N +
S)/2 due to the forced eccentricities of particles in the cloud. If the
cloud were symmetric about the Sun (i.e., if there were no offset), the
maximum and minimum brightnesses of the cloud would occur at perihelion
and aphelion, respectively. Looking at the model, one can see that the
minimum does occur at Earth's aphelion (282.9 deg). However, the minimum
of the COBE curve is clearly displaced from aphelion, showing that the
center of symmetry of the cloud is displaced from the Sun. If we could
turn off the effect of the Earth's eccentricity, we could isolate the
sine curve due to e(sub f). When we do this for the model cloud however,
we do not see a variation in (N + S)/2 for two reasons: 1) Although the
particle orbits are circularized due to Poynting Robertson drag (PR
drag), the wedge shape of the cloud cancels out any number density
variation as a function of radial distance; and 2) Even though we would
expect the orbits of the particles to be more densely spaced at
perihelion than at aphelion (provided all the particles had the same
e(sub f) and omega(sub f), due to Kepler's Second Law the particles
spend less time at perihelion than at aphelion thus canceling out any
noticeable effect on the number density. However, when we build a new
model cloud governed by a constant distribution of particles (1/r(exp
gamma) where gamma = 0) instead of a 1/r distribution, we do see a
sinusoidal variation in (N + S)/2 with ecliptic longitude of Earth.
These results imply that the particles contributing to the observed
offset do not have a PR drag distribution (i.e., they are not simply
asteroidal particles). Future work will determine whether cometary
particles (having a theoretical gamma = 1.5), collisionally evolved
asteroidal particles, or a combination of both types of particles are
responsible for the offset of the center of symmetry of the zodiacal
cloud.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Charged dust grains in a turbulent magnetic field will see a Lorentz
force due to the convection of the solar magnetic field past them at the
solar wind velocity. Since the sign of this magnetic field is randomly
varying, the direction of the force will be random, and the net effect
will be to randomly scatter the orbital elements of these particles. The
square roots of the mean square change in semimajor axis, inclination,
and eccentricity are determined as a function of the particles' original
orbital elements. Particles 3 microns in radius and smaller will have
their motions strongly perturbed or dominated by Lorentz scattering.
This scattering will have an effect comparable to, or greater than, the
Poynting-Robertson effect on these particles for time scales comparable
to their Poynting-Robertson lifetimes.},

It is shown that distinctive longitudinal variations in thermal flux

grains comprising the Solar System bands. In particular, how the
bands should vary if they are debris associated with the three
principal asteroid families is predicted. Based on these ideas, IRAS
observations may allow discrimination between asteroidal and cometary
origins of the dust bands and, perhaps, of the entire zodiacal cloud.},

   ABSTRACT  = {
   The effects of electrostatic forces and vertical random velocities of
   dust in the planetary dust rings on the static vertical dust density
   distribution were computed. It is shown that, when the dust particles
   are given a random velocity, there will be an increasing mixing of the
   different dust sizes as the random velocity is increased, but the
   electrostatic effect will still lead to the separation of dust particles
   according to size. A general trend in dust rings, where the largest dust
   particles are near the ring plane and the smallest and lightest
   particles are furthest above the plane, will be the existence of a halo
   of small dust particles with a degree of mixing of dust sizes near the
   ring plane.}

   Model calculations are used to determine the location of interplanetary
   dust particles that contribute most of the brightness of the zodiacal
   light as seen from earth, in and out of the ecliptic plane and in the

   latitude (beta), the distance to the earth decreases for dust
   contributing equal fractions to the line-of-sight brightness. This and
   other results will help in the analysis of: (1) structures in the
   observed brightness of the zodiacal light, (2) bands such as those
   observed by IRAS, (3) temporal variations in the brightness of the
   zodiacal light, (4) observations of the photometric axis, and (5) past

It is suggested that the larger of the two satellites bounding
Saturn's F-ring could have only one first-order resonance within the
ring. If such a resonance is present, a wave pattern of equally
spaced loops which co-rotate with the satellite could be excited.
This could account for the confinement of the ring particles and the
'braided' structure of the F-ring. While the theory does not account
for the third, diffuse ring, it is suggested that this ring consists
of micrometer-size particles generated in the main ring by erosion
due to meteroid impacts and sputtering and then removed by
electromagnetic forces.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The physical processes acting on charged microscopic dust grains in the
Jovian atmosphere involve electromagnetic forces which dominate dust
particle dynamics and diffusion across field lines resulting from random
charge fluctuations of the dust grains. A model of the Jovian ring
hypothesizes that the 'visible' ring particles are produced by erosive
collisions between an assumed population of kilometer-sized parent bodies
and submicron-sized magnetospheric dust particles. Fluctuations in the
ring topology and intensity are determined over various time scales,
showing that the ring is a quasipermanent and quasistable characteristic
of the Jovian system. Finally, the interaction of the Jovian energetic
belt electrons and the Jovian plasma with an ambient dust population is
examined; the distribution of dust ejected from Io in the inner
magnetosphere and losses of magnetospheric ions and electrons due to
direct collisions with charged dust particles are calculated.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
On 10 April 1996, we observed an occultation by Uranus of U138 (SAO
163583; Klemola and Mink, 1991, Astron. J. 102, 389) with the Faint
Object Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. The occultation
observation was spectrally-resolved, viewed simultaneously over the
wavelength range 2885 A to 7721 A. The high signal-to-noise ratio
provides an excellent profile of the Uranian rings, with a distinct
detection of the elusive [tex2html_wrap_inline16] ring during egress.
Comparisons between equivalent depths and wavelengths from the U138
occultation data allow us to gain a better understanding of the
particle size distribution within the rings. Previous occultation
observations have led to the conclusion that the nine classical
Uranian rings are composed primarily of cm-sized particles.
Conversely, the lambda ring is thought to contain smaller particles,
based on evidence from forward-scattered images and previous Voyager
occultation observations (French et al., 1991, , 327). It is known to
be azimuthally asymmetric (Showalter, 1995, Science 267, 490);
therefore, observations vary considerably and particle size
distribution over the ring is unknown. From our U138 data set, we
calculate the equivalent depth of the lambda ring and find no clear
variation of this parameter with wavelength. As azimuthal asymmetry
prevents generalizations over the entire ring, it is possible that
there are segments containing particles of different sizes. Our data
suggests that the portion of the lambda ring observed during the U138
occultation contains a significant number of micron-sized or larger
particles.},

observations of the smallest meteoroids leaving the solar system in
hyperbolic orbits due to radiation pressure (beta particles),
intermediate mass particles arriving from the heliocentric spacecraft
apex direction (alpha meteoroids) and the largest micrometeoroids

reviewed, and evidence for the three groups of dynamically different
micrometeoroids in lunar microcrater statistics is indicated. The
collisional model of the origin of dust particles from the dispersion
of sporadic meteoroids of cometary origin due to the
Poynting-Robertson effect and collisions is then applied to account
for the dynamics of the beta and alpha micrometeoroids.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The magnitudes of the excitation of free precession of the lunar spin
axis about the position defined by Cassini's laws, free libration in
longitude, and free wobble are determined as a function of meteorite
angular momentum relative to the lunar center of mass and the
position of impact on the lunar surface. Angular-momentum
conservation suffices for the estimates of precession and libration
excitation, but a cratering model for the ejecta distribution is
necessary for the estimate of the wobble excitation. The simultaneous
excitation of free wobble is always associated with the excitation of
precession, and the angular amplitude is at least comparable to, but
may exceed, that of the induced precession by a factor of 3 or 4. It
is possible to excite a free libration in longitude with no
first-order excitation of free wobble, but generally, all three free
motions are excited simultaneously. The induced libration will nearly
always have the largest amplitude. For crater sizes scaled as powers
of impact energy, impacts leaving craters as small as a few
kilometers in diameter can excite free motions which will ultimately
be observable by the lunar laser-ranging experiment.}

Porous or fluffy grains are commonly found in the interplanetary medium
and are suspected to be present in the interstellar medium or stellar
winds. Porosity can strongly enhance the secondary electron emission
resulting from electron bombardment through a different emission process
usually neglected for smooth grain surfaces. A quite different behavior
of dust grains can result when they are embedded in astrophysical
plasmas. In particular electrostatic breaking can occur less easily in
hot plasmas and more easily in cold (and tenuous) plasmas, with
consequences for grain size distributions. Interstellar chemistry can
also be modified.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Saturn's icy moon Enceladus is enigmatic because, despite its small size
(radius about 250 km) its resurfaced terrains of multiple ages indicate
a long history of significant internal heating and accompanying volcanic
activity.  There is even good reason to believe that volcanism continues
at present because the satellite appears to be the source of Saturn's
E-ring.  Recent results suggest that Enceladus has only a very small
rocky component, effectively eliminating the possibility of significant
radiogenic heating.  Enceladus is currently locked in a 2:1 orbital
resonance with Dione which enhances the tidal heat budget of these two
satellites.  We examine the orbital and thermal histories of Enceladus
and Dione by means of numerical integration of theequations of motion,
coupled through tidal friction to simple heat-balance equations
describing the thermal evolutions of the two moons.},

A significant flux of ejecta from lunar impacts of interplanetary dust
particles leaves selenocentric space and enters the magnetosphere of the
earth. During favorable lunar phases, 80% of the ejecta enter the
magnetosphere where their orbits are determined by electrodynamic as well
as gravitational forces. Initial study of the orbital characteristics and
perturbations of these magnetosphere ejecta is presented and its
implications are discussed.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
We have already shown that a planet orbiting beta Pictoris is able to
confine the circumstellar dust. Here we present new numerical
simulations which improve this model. The new model takes into account
destructive collisions between particles, and looks at the steady state
between the collision and the dust replenishment. We show that there
exists a critical value of the normal optical depth (tauopc ~ 4 x 10^-4)
and if the optical depth is smaller than this critical value in the
resonant region (20-50 AU), asymmetric structures are created by the
planet and maintained in spite of collisions. Although these structures
cannot explain the asymmetries now observed in the disk, they could be a
way to reveal bodies otherwise invisible by direct imagery. },

  ABSTRACT      = {
The satellite system of Neptune is so irregular that some formation
mechanism or subsequent dynamical evolution that sets it apart from
the other, more regular, satellite systems is obviously indicated.
McKinnon argued that satellite capture is the most likely possibility
and has shown that tidal circularization of Triton's presumably
highly eccentric initial orbit probably resulted in melting of the
satellite's interior. The satellite system of Uranus, although
somewhat bland, also has a number of special features that indicate
an interesting dynamical history. These include the anomalously high
orbital inclination of Miranda and the probable coexistence of small
satellites and narrow rings inside the plant's Roche limit. The
possibility that orbital evolution due to tidal dissipation is
involved in both of these phenomena is discussed. Other topics
discussed are: the origin of rings; the formation of coorbital
satellites; the lack of stable orbit-orbit resonances in the Uranian
satellite system; and chaos, tidal heating and the shapes of Miranda
and Ariel.},

The dynamics of small-sized dust grains was studied in the Martian
environment in connection with the possible detection of dust
particles by the Phobos 2 spacecraft. The motion of submicron-sized
particles is influenced not only by gravity but also by solar
radiation pressure and electromagnetic forces. Depending on the size
and on the actual varying interplanetary parameters, some of these
small-sized grains ejected from Phobos at speeds on the order of a
few tens m/s, can stay in orbit around Mars for several months
forming a non-uniform and time-dependent dust halo.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The dynamical mechanisms in interplanetary space and in the F corona
were studied using numerical simulations. An expression for the
radiation pressure force due to a rotating spherical source of radiation
was derived. Also, expressions relating the variation in inclination and
the longitude of the ascending node to the solar magnetic field were
derived. The latter are based on the spherical source surface model of
the solar magnetic field. Simulation of particles released during
perihelion passages of comet Encke show that cometary particles have
lifetimes shorter than the lifetime calculated by Wyatt and Whipple in
1950. These simulations also resulted in higher eccentricities and a
definite alignment of the particles' aphelia toward a direction 20 deg.
east of the vernal equinox. An expression relating the size of a
planet's zone of influence to perturbations on particles in solar orbits
based on the closest approach between the planet and the particle show
that the expression for the size of a planet's zone of influence is not
singular, but varies with the particular orbital element which is being
studied. Simulations of the interaction of the Lorentz force in the F
corona, based on observed solar magnetic field values, result in a
spreading of the inclinations of particles in circumsolar orbits. This
result, along with a reevaluation of recent observations of the F
corona, leads to the conclusion that the shape of the circumsolar dust
cloud cannot be a ring, but must be a wide band or a spherical shell.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Current understandings of the interplanetary medium, made up of the solar
wind and its associated magnetic field, and of planetary magnetospheres
are reviewed. The extent and structure of the interplanetary medium, which
is believed to merge with the interstellar medium at a heliocentric
distance of about 100 AU and consist of spiralling gas streams of varying
velocities and magnetic field lines, are considered, and the effects of
the solar wind on cometary gas in its path are noted. The interactions of
the solar wind with magnetized planets giving rise to planetary
magnetospheres is discussed, and the known magnetospheres of the earth,
moon, Venus, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn are examined in detail.
Prospects for studies of the magnetospheres of planets beyond Saturn,
particularly that of Uranus, are indicated, and it is pointed out that
whereas the presence of a solar wind may not be necessary for the
formation of trapped radiation belts, it is unlikely that there exists any
planetary body outside the influence of stellar or interstellar winds.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Jupiter's diffuse ring system is upon reexamination of Voyager images
noted to be composed of a relatively bright narrow ring and an inner
toroidal halo as well as the 'gossamer' exterior ring, while the
previously suspected inner disk is missing. Several narrow, bright
features are visible in the main ring, and are suggested to be
related in some way to Adrastea and Metis. The smallest ring
particles and the dark, rough, red largest bodies both have total
optical depths of 1-6 x 10 to the -6th. After arising at the bright
ring's inner boundary, the halo rapidly expands inward to a 20,000-km
thickness, and disappears at a radius of 90,000 km halfway between
the main ring and the planet's cloudtops.},

The characteristics and distribution of the small particles detected

2 encounter with Uranus in January 1986 are examined.  The nature of
the observational data and the analysis techniques employed are
discussed, and the results are presented in graphs. Particles of rms
mass about 2.6 ng and radii of a few microns were found in an impact
region of thickness 3840 km, with a maximum number density of 1600/cu
m about 280 km from the equatorial plane, shortly after Voyager 2
crossed the plane of the Uranian rings. The possible origin of the
particles in the rings or in small satellites outside the rings is
considered.},

The apparent closest approach of the star SAO186001 to Neptune was
observed photoelectrically on July 22, 1984 at Cerro Tololo
Inter-American Observatory. A 32-percent signal drop, lasting about
1.2 s, was probably caused by a partially transparent arc of material
at a distance of 67,000 km from Neptune.  Neptune's arc(s) do not
vary smoothly with azimuth, unlike the rings of other Jovian planets.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Incomplete arc rings orbiting Neptune have been discovered from the
ground, and have been recently observed by the Voyager spacecraft.
The possible models accounting for the stability of the three dense
arc structures embedded in the faint 63,000 km ring are reviewed.
These different models are discussed both from a purely theoretical
point of view, and in relation to observations of Neptune's ring
system. Subsequently, other dynamical aspects of the Neptune ring
system are analyzed including timescales for dynamical repulsion of
the rings in the radial direction by nearby shepherding moons and the
energy liberated by this process. An attempt is made to assess what
may be special about the dynamical environment of Neptune's 63 K ring
and how such an environment may be responsible for the unusual
azimuthal structure observed in this ring.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Satellites smaller than Mimas (r = 195 km) are distinguished by
irregular overall shapes and by rough limb topography. Material
properties and impact cratering dominate the shaping of these
objects. Long fragmentation histories can produce a variety of
internal structures, but so far there is no direct evidence that any
small satellite is an equilibrium ellipsoid made up of noncohesive
gravitationally bound rubble. One many bodies that orbit close to
their primary the tidal and rotational components of surface gravity
strongly affect the directions of local g and thereby affect the
redistribution of regolith by mass wasting. Downslope movement of
regolith is extensive on Deimos, and is probably effective on many
other small satellites. It is shown that in some cases observed
patterns of downslope mass wasting cold produce useful constraints on
the satellite's mean density. The diversity of features seen in the
few high-resolution images of small satellites currently available
suggests that these objects have undergone complex histories of
cratering, fragmentation, and regolith evolution.}

  ABSTRACT      = {
           Coronal holes produce high-speed, low-density, and
           high-temperature streams that propagate into the
           interplanetary space. These streams interact with
           the slow-speed, high-density, and low-temperature
           stream of the ambient solar wind. We investigate
           this problem using the time-dependent, two-
           dimensional hydrodynamic model in the spherical-
           equatorial coordinate system. More accurate
           numerical methods and finer difference meshes used
           enable us to track the evolution of detailed
           features of the fast and slow stream interaction.
           An analysis of formation of shock pairs (forward
           and reverse shocks) is presented for both erupting
           and corotating parts of fast streams. Further, it
           is shown that the process of interaction of fast
           and slow solar wind streams may contain richer
           structures. Such structures may originate during
           the reconfinement process (internal shocks),
           spatial substructures (flux tubes), and small
           temporal modulations (shock wings). They may
           influence the global shape of stream interfaces and
           heating of the plasma. Finally, conclusion can be
           made that boundaries between the fast and slow
           coronal streams seem to be stable against small
           random fluctuations and against small-introduced
           disturbances and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
           is not initiated.}

  ABSTRACT      = {
The observed sharp drop in the geometric albedo of Titan shortward of
6000 A (also observed for Jupiter and Saturn) has been tentatively
attributed to the presence of small absorbing particles referred to as
Axel dust. The properties of Axel dust particles are studied, with the
effect of scattering included through Mie theory, in an attempt to
obtain a physically plausible set of parameters that properly
characterizes the dust. Quantitative characteristics of the dust are
described, scattering and absorption properties of various particle size
distributions are calculated, and fits are made to observations of Titan
and Saturn. It is found that: (1) a flat distribution of particle radii
up to 0.1 micron and an imaginary part of the refractive index that
varies as the -2.5 power of wavelength produce a good fit for Titan
provided the extinction optical depth of the satellite's atmosphere is
about 10 at 5000 A; (2) a clear layer of about 7 km-am hydrogen is
required above the dust for a good fit to Saturn with the same dust
properties; and (3) the inclusion of dust significantly increases the
computed abundance of methane over the value given by reflecting-layer
models.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Significant new contributions to the understanding of statistical and
evolutionary aspects of cometary orbits are discussed. The frequency
of passes of long-period (LP) comets on earth-crossing orbits is
estimated to be about 3/yr, although this only refers to comets
brighter than H10 of about 10.5. The tidal force of the galactic disk
plays a dominant role in driving comets to the planetary region. From
time to time, random encounters with molecular clouds or close
stellar passages may overcome the galactic effect. The onset of comet
showers may result from passing molecular clouds or stars penetrating
very deeply in the Oort cloud.  The enhancement in the frequency of
comet passages during a shower depends on the radial distribution of
Oort cloud comets. The distribution of aphelion points of young and
new comets on the celestial sphere shows a galactic dependence,
suggesting that the frequency of comet passages is currently at, or
near, its background level.},

high resolution of the HST allowed to discriminate the nucleus
against the bright coma. The reduced V magnitude of the nucleus
ranges between 15.5 and 15.9. Assuming a geometric albedo of 0.04, we
found a rather spherical body with a mean radius of 2.68km.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The charging of dust grains in the Jupiter and Saturn magnetospheric
plasmas and the resulting dynamic effects are discussed. Collisions
of dust particles with magnetospheric electrons cause dust particles
to become negatively charged if the electron flux exceeds the
photoelectron flux at a given distance from the Sun. The charged dust
particles interact with a planetary magnetic field via the Lorentz
force. Only for very small particles the Lorentz force exceeds the
gravitational force of the planet. In most observationally relevant
cases (Jupiter's and Saturn's ring systems) electromagnetic forces
cause only small perturbations of the Keplerian orbits. Local
fluctuations of the plasma parameters change the charge of the
particles and lead to spatial diffusion. Small changes in the plasma
environment of a ring of particulates may release large quantities of
dust grains by electrostatic blow-off. Drag forces induced by the
magnetospheric plasma compete with the radiation pressure drag
outside the synchronous orbit.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Collisional heating of an interplanetary dust grain by solar
energetic particles and the sputtering process that follows such
collisions are studied for grain materials of water-ice, obsidian,
and magnetite. It is found that because of the size dependence of the
absorption property of a grain for incident photons the ratio of
heating rate by solar particles to that by solar photons increases as
the radius of the grain decreases. However, this ratio is somewhat
smaller than unity, e.g., only about 0.01 even for a small grain with
a radius of 0.01 micron, and consists of transparent materials in the
visible range. Compared with the strong size dependence of the mass
loss rate of a grain per unit surface due to sublimation, the mass
loss rate due to sputtering is independent of grain radius;
furthermore, its gradual decrease with solar distance is greater than
that due to sublimation.},

We surveyed the IRAS data base at the positions of the 1808 O6-B9.5 stars
in The Bright Star Catalog for extended objects with excess emission at 60
microns, indicating the presence of interstellar dust at the location of
the star. Within 400 pc the filling factor of the interstellar medium, for
dust clouds with a density greater than 0.5/cu cm is 14.6 + or - 2.4%.
Above a density of 1.0/cu cm, the density distribution function appears to
follow a power law index - 1.25. When the dust clouds are mapped onto the
galactic plane, the sun appears to be located in a low-density region of
the interstellar medium of width about 60 pc extending at least 500 pc in
the direction of longitudes 80 deg - 260 deg, a feature we call the 'local
trough'.},

Three Perseid meteoroids assumed to be fragments of a larger body were
observed on near parallel trajectories on August 12, 1977 between 0305.21
and 0305.23 UT. The mass of the parent body is estimated at 0.0003 kg with
a radius of approximately 6 mm (assuming the parent body was roughly
spherical and had a typical Perseid density of 290 kg/cu m). An upper
limit to the distance of breakup point from the earth's surface can be
placed between 0.004 and 0.04 AU. The probabilities of collision and
breakup of the parent Perseid with three classes of dust particle
(interplanetary, magnetospheric, and lunar ejecta) in near earth space at
the time of the observation are given.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The disparity between fragment velocities, as determined from laboratory
experiments, and those typically observed in asteroid families has been
noted previously. While median velocities in small-scale tests are
typically less than 10 m/s, relative velocities inferred from
measurements of asteroid orbital elements are commonly of order 100 m/s.
Resolution of this discrepancy has been hindered in part by the
inability to experimentally simulate asteroid-size collisions.  In
particular, the collisional breakup of small bodies (diameters less than
about 10 km) may be complicated by the dependence of material strength
on strain-rate, while larger bodies are effectively strengthened by
gravitational self-compression.  As a result of these factors, fragment
velocities for decimeter-size targets are not expected to be
representative of those for asteroidal collisions.  An experimental
technique has been developed to address the fragmentation of large
asteroids, for which the effects of material strength are small compared
to those of gravitational self compression.  In order to simulate a
target body whose radius is R, an experiment is performed in which a
much smaller target is fragmented while being subjected to a gas
overpressure that matches the average lithostatic stress in the interior
of the body of radius R.  Experiments are described in which ejection
velocities are measured for fragmentation events conducted in a
pressurized environment. These results provide the first direct
experimental evidence applicable to large-scale collisions.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Particulate matter possessing lunar escape velocity sufficient to enhance
the cislunar meteroid flux was investigated. While the interplanetary flux
was extensively studied, lunar ejecta created by the impact of this
material on the lunar surface is only now being studied. Two recently
reported flux models are employed to calculate the total mass impacting
the lunar surface due to sporadic meteor flux. There is ample evidence to
support the contention that the sporadic interplanetary meteoroid flux
enhances the meteroid flux of cislunar space through the creation of
micron and submicron lunar ejecta with lunar escape velocity.},

abstract = {We investigate numerically and analytically size-polydisperse granular mixtures immersed into a molecular gas. We show that the equipartition of granular temperatures of particles of different sizes is established; however, the granular temperatures significantly differ from the temperature of the molecular gas. This result is surprising since, generally, the energy equipartition is strongly violated in driven granular mixtures. Qualitatively, the obtained results do not depend on the collision model, being valid for a constant restitution coefficient $\epsilon$, as well as for the $\epsilon$ for viscoelastic particles. Our findings may be important for astrophysical applications, such as protoplanetary disks, interstellar dust clouds, and comets.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The particle properties and processes in the Uranian rings are
analyzed from Voyager observations and ground-based data. Occultation
observations of the epsilon ring are interpreted to yield an
effective size of the ring particles that exceeds 70 cm, a surface
mass density that exceeds 80 g/sq cm, and a ring vertical thickness
greater than tens of meters for solid ice particles. The particles
forming the classic rings are dark and gray, with albedo of 0.014
+/-0.004. It is argued that the small amount of dust that exists in
the classical rings and between the rings in bands is created by
erosion of ring particles and unseen satellites resulting from
collisions and micrometeoroid bombardment. As proposed for regions of
the other known ring systems, new ring material can be continually
created by the destruction of small moons near the rings, which may
explain the youthful appearance of the Uranian rings.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The present study compares properties of near solar dust, deduced
from inversion of F-corona brightness data, with calculations of
fluffy aggregate particles. It is shown that silicate particles
containing a slight amount of absorbing material have temperatures
below the blackbody temperature if the impurity amounts to less than
0.1\% in volume. This effect is especially significant for porous
particles and points to the existence of such a component, possibly
cometary dust, in the solar vicinity. In particular the silicate
particles with a large impurity, which show a higher temperature than
the blackbody at the same solar distance, sublimate at a larger solar
distance. As the impurity decreases, the sublimation starts closer to
the sun and the pure silicate, if it would exist, would survive even
at about 2 solar radii from the sun. This result which is based on
calculations that apply model materials, may possibly explain the
wide extended zone of sublimation derived from F-corona brightness
data. Another finding of our calculations is an unexpected
enhancement of temperature of the two-component aggregates. Namely
the silicate aggregate with absorbing impurities attains higher
temperature even than the pure carbon. This happens when the volume
fraction of absorbing material exceeds 1\% and the aggregate with a
fractal dimension of 2.98 is located below about 100 solar radii from
the sun; this critical solar distance depends on the volume fraction
of absorbing material. A similar trend was also seen in the compact
particle consisting of two components. This comes from the complex
dependence of the energy loss from the particle on the temperature.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Infrared light can penetrate the dense clouds of gas and dust that
are present in the galactic plane; consequently, the appearance of
the infrared sky is significantly different from that at visible
wavelengths.  Visible-light measurements are therefore useless for
predicting the appearance of the infrared sky with any fidelity.
Thus, space surveillance programs requiring knowledge of the infrared
celestial background need direct infrared measurements at the
wavelengths of interest. The purpose of this project is to identify
the structure of the infrared sky at a wide range of spatial scales.
Our work has concentrated on producing two new sources of
information: measurements made at higher spatial resolutions than is
possible with data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS);
and information at spatial scales that is not available in previously
published maps. The goal of this multiyear effort was to ascertain
the physical phenomena that produce the spatial and spectral
structure seen in the infrared sky. This information can then be used
to predict the background that might be seen by a given infrared
sensor that is attempting to locate targets against the infrared sky
or to see celestial objects for calibration.}

The relative strength of gravitational and radiative-pressure forces

pressure would drive from the system any spherical particles of

All three Apollo 17 astronauts sketched a `lunar horizon glow', seen from
orbit above the moon. It is shown that the shape of the glow is compatible
with scattering of sunlight off of gas or dust at high altitudes above the
moon. The present mathematical modeling best simulates the glow with
submicron dust grains whose spatial density varies with altitude above the
moon as exp(-H/H(s)), where H(s) is in the range of 5 to 20 km.  These
dust grains are probably electrically charged and ejected above the lunar
surface by local electric fields.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The origin of asteroid families in terms of collisional breakup is
analyzed using the data by Williams (1979).  The observed mass
distributions of families and its implications are discussed, and the
distributions of relative velocities are analyzed via a simplified
one-dimensional approach, separating the entire sample of families
into a few subclasses sharing some important 'physical' features. The
possibility of reconstructing the three-dimensional ejection velocity
pattern of the objects forming a family from the proper elements is
discussed, and it is shown that this potentially fruitful method
fails to provide relevant results because of the difficulties noted
by Brouwer (1951).},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The Kelperian motion of dust particles in the solar system is mainly
influenced by the electromagnetic and plasma Poynting-Robertson drag.
The first force is isotropic while the second one shows latitudinal
variations due to the observed differences of the solar wind parameters
in the ecliptic plane and over the solar poles. Close to the Sun other
effects become important, e.g. sublimation and sputtering, as well as
for submicron particles Lorentz scattering has to be taken into account.
These forces are very weak for dust grains of moderate size (10-100
microns) not too close (greater than 0.03 AU) to the Sun and are
neglected here. Assuming that the general form of the latidudinally
dependent force is a series expansion in Legendre polynomials, we have
studied the averaged equations of motion for the classical elements and
found the first integral of them. The general character of motion is the
same as for the classical Poynting-Robertson drag: particles spiral
towards the Sun. The new features in the orbital evolution under the
latitudinally dependent force as compared with the isotropic
Poynting-Robertson drag are: (1) not only the semimajor axis a and the
eccentricity epsilon but also the argument of the perihelion omega
varies with time, (2) the rate of change of a, epsilon, omega depends on
the inclination. An example of particle trajectories in the phase space
of elements is presented.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Dust particles (micrometeorites) were directly observed by Helios in
the inner solar system. One of the two sensors in each of the two
space probes looks in the direction of the ecliptic plane, the other
is tilted to the south (Helios 1) or to the north (Helios 2). The
experimental setup is constituted by a protective cover against solar
wind and solar radiation, an impact ionization detector, and a time
of flight mass spectrometer. The experiment is calibrated with dust
particle accelerators. Several hundred micrometeorites are registered
by the detectors on each of the space probes; their impact rates are
determined. Particle orbit observations show that many particles run
on hyperbolic orbits aiming out of the solar system; the origin of
these particles could not be determined. The investigations of
chemical composition and density of micrometeorites suggest two
classes: chondritic particles relating to the more frequent stone
meteorites, and iron-rich particles similar to iron meteorites.},

The origin of the rings of Uranus and Neptune is considered by
performing two types of stochastic simulations of the
collisional history of small moons: Monte Carlo simulations in
which only the largest surviving fragments from each disruption
is followed, and a Markov chain approach which makes it possible
to follow the size distribution from each disruption to
arbitrarily small sizes. Results indicate that the population of
small satellites around Uranus and Neptune have evolved through
catastrophic fragmentation since the end of planet and satellite
formation 3 to 4 billion years ago.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Recent developments in the study of the gas-plasma interaction at Io
and in the Io plasma torus are reviewed. It is suggested that the
'energy crisis' in the hot Io plasma torus may be partially resolved
by a local energy generation mechanism such as the magnetic pumping
process. It is also argued that the Jovian ring could act as an
additional plasma source in injecting cold plasma component into the
inner plasma torus, and that the formation of an ion wake may permit
a much more extended electromagnetic coupling between Io and the
Jovian ionosphere.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Attention is centered on cosmic-dust measures made by sensors on
Pioneers 8 and 9 in earthlike orbits. The conclusion is that the
particles are largely 'beta-meteoroids', interplanetary impact debris
expelled by solar radiation pressure. Analysis of periodic-comet
orbits and comets observed during the missions failed to yield
correlations, except possibly for debris from Comet Encke. A
treatment of beta-meteoroids from this stream is presented. The
solar-centered maximum impact rate is considered and indicates that
formation of the observed beta-meteoroids occurs more at solar
distances greater than 0.5 AU rather than less. The interesting
variation of observed pulse heights with impact direction is analyzed
and qualitatively explained in terms of a narrow distribution
function of particle masses among the beta-meteoroids.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Because of the non-existent or very weak intrinsic planetary magnetic
field, the solar wind interaction process at Mars is characterized by
direct streaming of the solar wind plasma flow through the Martian
exosphere. Also as a result of the low gravity at Mars, rather
extended distributions of hot oxygen atoms and cold hydrogen atoms
could be found even at altitudes of a few thousand km. The ionization
and subsequent pickup of such exospheric ions by the interplanetary
electric field could have very important consequences on the
structure of the bow shock, the injection of planetary heavy ions
into the magnetospheric environment, and non-thermal mass loss. The
hydrogen component of the exosphere might play a particularly
important role in creating a seed population of reflecting ions as
well as depleting the solar wind plasma - via charge exchange process
- near the magnetopause.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Four types of meteoritic material should be found on Mars: (1)
micrometeorites, many of which will survive atmospheric entry unmelted,
which should fall relatively uniformly over the planet's surface, (2)
ablation products from larger meteorites which ablate, break up and burn
up in the Mars atmosphere, (3) debris from large, crater forming objects,
which, by analogy to terrestrial and lunar impact events, will be
concentrated in the crater ejecta blankets (except for rare, large events,
such as the proposed C-T event on earth, which can distribute debris on a
planetary scale), and (4) debris from the early, intense bombardment,
which, in many areas of the planet, may now be incorporated into rocks by
geologic processes subsequent to the intense bombardment era. To estimate
the extent of meteoritic addition to indigenous Martian material, the
meteoritic flux on Mars must be known. It is estimated that the overall
flux is twice that for the Moon and 1.33 that for Earth. For small
particles, whose orbital evolution is dominated by Poynting Robertson
drag, the flux at Mars can be estimated from the Earth flux. The smaller
Martian gravitational enhancement as well as the decrease in the spatial
density of interplanetary dust with increasing heliocentric distance
should reduce the flux of small particles at Mars to about 0.33 times the
flux at Earth. Because of the smaller planetary cross-section the total
infalling mass at Mars is then estimated to be 0.09 time the infalling
mass in the micrometeorite size range at Earth.},

Regolith formation on the Martian satellites is considered as a
stochastic process. Each cratering event is further divided into five

formation and recapturing of ejecta from circum-Mars orbits.

  ABSTRACT      =
{
Concerned about the safety of the Cassini orbiter when it pierces the ring
plane during its orbital tour, we explored the orbital histories and
reaccretion of circumplanetary particles across inner regions of the
Saturnian system. Our goal is to find locales just exterior to the rings
that might be depleted dynamically of orbital debris. Using a regularized
mixed variable symplectic integrator, we numerically computed the paths of
test particles distributed uniformly between 2.4 - 24 Saturn radii, for
1000 years. Our model included the gravitational effects
of Saturn (up to J_2) and all the classical satellites
out to Titan. Particles were followed until they impacted a moon, entered
the main ring, or traveled well beyond Hyperion's orbit.

The numerical simulations showed that the orbital eccentricities and
inclinations of test particles were appreciably influenced only in the
immediate neighborhoods of the satellites, as well as at the 2:1 and (to a
much lesser degree) 3:1 resonances of Titan; effects of a secular resonance
appear just near Rhea. Simulations of material in Mimas' vicinity find that
particles, whether launched from the satellite or distributed uniformly
across semimajor axis, are swept clear within a (theoretically predicted)
region in which orbits eventually cross the satellite's; the nearby
satellite's orbital eccentricity broadens this sweep-up region by imposing a
forced eccentricity on the particles' orbits. Particles typically collide
with satellites in about a hundred years. A few particles are trapped along
stable horseshoe and tadpole orbits.

  ABSTRACT      = {
In the present consideration of the structural and particle
properties of Saturn's rings, emphasis is given to spacecraft
observations and an attempt is made to relate observed properties to
favored causative processes. While the ring particles are primarily
icy, there is evidence for compositional variation on both local and
regional scales. Ring structure is generally dominated by collisional
and gravitational dynamics. On the basis of such features as orbital
resonances with various satellites, which drive spiral density and
bending waves, the ring mass density and local vertical thickness can
be determined.},

The generation of surface waves due to a strong gradient in the

plasma torus are found to be a viable mechanism for particle
acceleration leading to a beam of energetic electrons along the

kiloelectronvolts is possible and this might explain the intense
auroral hiss observed near the inner edge of the Io plasma torus by

  ABSTRACT      = {
Assuming that the micron-sized particles making up the bright Jovian
ring are fragments of erosive collisions between micrometeoroid
projectiles and large parent bodies, a physical model of the ring is
calculated. This leads to a well-defined size distribution for the
ejecta, whose optical properties can be compared with observation.
The (most likely silicate) ejecta material maximum diameter is
estimated to be 0.1 micron, and most likely the result of Io volcanic
activity. The impact model's determination of ejecta size
distribution in turn determines the structure of the ring, with the
largest ejecta forming the bright ring, medium-sized ejecta forming a
disk that extends to the Jovian atmosphere, and small ejecta forming
a faint halo whose structure is dominated by electromagnetic forces.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Initial results from the measurement conducted by the dust particle
experiment on the lunar orbiting satellite Lunar Explorer 35 (LE 35) were
reported with the data interpreted as indicating that the moon is a
significant source of micrometeroids. Primary sporadic and stream
meteoroids impacting the surface of the moon at hypervelocity was proposed
as the source of micron and submicron particles that leave the lunar
craters with velocities sufficient to escape the moon's gravitational
sphere of influence. No enhanced flux of lunar ejecta with masses greater
than a nanogram was detected by LE 35 or the Lunar Orbiters. Hypervelocity
meteoroid simulation experiments concentrating on ejecta production
combined with extensive analyses of the orbital dynamics of micron and
submicron lunar ejecta in selenocentric, cislunar, and geocentric space
have shown that a pulse of these lunar ejecta, with a time correlation
relative to the position of the moon relative to the earth, intercepts the
earth's magnetopause surface (EMPs). As shown, a strong reason exists for
expecting a significant enhancement of submicron dust particles in the
region of the magnetosphere between L values of 1.2 and 3.0. This is the
basis for the proposal of a series of experiments to investigate the
enhancement or even trapping of submicron lunar ejecta in this region. The
subsequent interaction of this mass with the upper-lower atmosphere of the
earth and possible geophysical effects can then be studied.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Voyager 2 images of the Neptunian ring system show it to be
relatively dusty with the fraction of micron-sized dust
particles in the rings between about 0.2 and 0.7 (Smith et al.,
1989). This paper applies a numerical model developed for the
Uranus dust bands to the Neptune system. The results show the
following: (1) the suggested bimodal distribution of dust
fractions in the rings is not related to ring optical depth and
may be due to different ring particle size distributions, (2)
collision velocities between the macroscopic ring particles must
be about 1 m/sec if they are to produce dust fractions above
1/2, (3) the small moons of Neptune must have regoliths for
meteoroid excavation to produce the dust population at Voyager
ring plane crossing, and (4) dust optical depths interior to
1989N3R are negligible unless there are unseen macroscopic
source bodies in that region.},

The instantaneous rates of change for the orbital elements
eccentricity, longitude of perigee from the Sun, and longitude from

case of the inclination i = 0.  The results confirm the validity of
using mean rates when the orbits are tightly bound to the planet and
serve as examples to be reproduced by the complicated numerical
solutions required for arbitrary inclination.  Strongly bound
hydrogen atoms escaping from Earth due to radiation pressure do not
seem a likely cause of the geotail extending in the anti-sun
direction. Instead, radiation pressure will cause those particles'
orbits to deteriorate into the Earth's atmosphere.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The charged particles considered are scattered by random fields while they
propagate along the diverging lines of force of a spatially inhomogeneous
guiding field. Their longitudinal transport is described in terms of the
eigenfunctions of a Sturm-Liouville operator which incorporates the effect
of adiabatic focusing along with that of scattering. The relaxation times
and characteristic velocities which appear in this matrix formulation of
the transport problem are graphed and tabulated. Explicit formulas which
describe the particle-density profile that results from a localized
impulsive injection are derived for two different regimes.  In the first
regime, where focusing is relatively weak, a diffusive mode of propagation
is dominant, but coherent modes are also present, and they become
prominent as the intensity of focusing increases. In the second regime,
where focusing is strong and where diffusion does not occur, the
propagation is purely coherent. The existence of this supercoherent mode
of particle transport opens up many possibilities for the interpretation
of astrophysical phenomena.}

  ABSTRACT      = {
Packing forces, produced by an anisotropic sublimation of mantle
material of grains located at the surface layer of loosely
conglomerated fluffy particles, move the grains toward the center of
the fluffy particles. This leads to a reduction of the empty space
inside the fluffy particle and consequently to an increase of the
mass density of the fluffy particle with time. As observed by the
Helios dust experiment, fluffy particles of low density are ejected
by comets with high eccentricity e and large semimajor axis a. Since
e and a of fluffy particles decrease with time due to the Poynting
Robertson effect, the accompanying increase of the density of fluffy
particles seems to explain the existence of normal dense particles in
quasi-circular orbits as detected during in situ measurements. It

The first photometric measurements of Titan in the mid-IR free of
possible contamination from long-wavelength filter leaks are reported. A
low-resolution spectrum covering the last unobserved gap in Titan's
near-IR spectrum from 3.1 to 5.1 micron is shown. A series of
photometric measurements is reported that may lay the foundation for
long-term searches for variations in the albedos. Low-resolution spectra
of Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa are also reported along with marginal
detections of Neptune at 4.8 micron and two 4.8 micron observations of
Uranus.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Dust ejection efficiency from Phobos/Deimos controls dust abundance of
Martian dust torus.  Martian oblateness effect and solar radiation
pressure enhance abundance of particles with radius 20-200mm of Phobos'
dust torus.  This is compatible with typical size of Phobos' surface
regolith.  Ejecta from torus particles-satellite collision should be the
most important dust source.  Dust number density and optical depth are
estimated for future PLANET-B mission.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The dynamical evolution of dust particles forming a circumstellar
disk around Beta Pictoris is followed by numerical simulations on a
Connection Machine. The disk appears to be cleared inside a radius of
about 20 AU. We integrate simultaneously the orbits of 8000 dust
particles subjected to Poynting-Robertson drag and perturbed by one
alleged planet. The simulations show that a planet revolving about
Beta Pictoris at a mean distance of 20 AU with a mass of at least 2 x
10 exp -5 central stellar mass can confine the disk by outer
resonance trapping. The azimuthal density distribution of particles
which shows very strong variations appears to be stationary in a
frame rotating with the planet.},

Studies of the dynamics of small interplanetary particles are
reviewed. The size frequency and spatial distribution of
interplanetary dust, the dynamical effects on submicron-sized
particles, and the dynamics of zodiacal light particles are examined.
The effects of the Poynting-Robertson effect and collisions between
interplanetary meteoroids are discussed. In addition, consideration
is given to the balance between the different dynamical effects.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Measurements of the flux of picogram-sized dust particles in selenocentric
cislunar and interplanetary space between 1.0 and 1.6 AU have been
performed by various spacecraft. Evidence of lunar secondary ejecta
resulting from the primary impact of interplanetary dust particles was
found in data from Lunar Explorer 35. Results of simulation studies and
spacecraft measurements indicate that a major portion of the lunar ejecta
which escape the earth-moon system dwell in a very special zone in
heliocentric space: a region symmetrical with the ecliptic plane and very
narrow. Gegenschein measurements reported by Roosen (1971) show a maximum
intensity in the ecliptic plane, but the distribution is asymmetric.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The external gravitational field produced by a rigid body of uniform density
but irregular shape is formulated in terms of spherical harmonics. The
formalism is applied to the Martian satellite Phobos. Based on a
three-dimensional shape model of Phobos by Duxbury (1989), the gravitational
coefficients up to degree and order 4 for a homogeneous Phobos are computed.
In particular, J2 is found to be 0.105. The in-plane libration amplitude of
a homogeneous Phobos is predicted to be 0.97 deg, within the rather large
uncertainty of the observed value of 0.78 + or - 0.4 deg.},

The authors provide criteria for which runaway growth is gonna happen:
 - lower velocities of the embryo compared to the smaller ones
 i.e. important are evolutionary values of Theta and K's. They test these
conclusions by numerical experimentsin the following cases:
o Safronov case:  pure gravity, no energy partition = positive viscous stirring
o Nakagawa case:  + gas drag
o + Energy equipartition:  ===> smaller are heated up, larger cooled down
o + with a larger seed body ===> fastest growth!!!

The orbits of Titan, Hyperion, and Iapetus have been generated by both
numerical integration and analytical theories and fitted to astrometric
observations made in the period 1967-1982. For Titan and Iapetus the two
fits to the observations were of similar accuracy, but for Hyperion the
numerical integration was significantly better. The numerical
integration gave good determinations of the mass ratio Titan/Saturn of
(2.36777 + or - 0.00055) x 10 to the -4th, the dynamical flattening J2
of Saturn (0.01675 + or - 0.00089) and the mass ratio Saturn/sun of
(2.85877 + or - 0.00021) x 10 to the -4th. A direct comparison of the
analytical theories with the numerical integrations has been made and
reveals very clearly the inadequacies of the theories.},

Solar wind speed maps on the source surface were derived from
interplanetary scintillation observations and refined using Sakigake
and Suisei data. During September-November of 1985, the leading edge
of the northern high-speed region had a large latitudinal speed
gradient of about 40 km/s/deg and inclined at a small angle to the
longitudinal direction on the source surface. During January-April of
1986, the southern high-speed region did not have a sharp leading
edge; a temperature increase was observed while a density increase
was not.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The visible trace of the interplanetary dust cloud, so-called the zodiacal
light, has already been photographed from the Moon, more than twenty years
ago (part 1). The interplanetary dust grains do not only scatter solar
light; they produce a thermal emission in the near infrared domain; also
they may impact the Earth and Moon system as they spiral towards the Sun
(part 2). The main problems which can be anticipated for Moon based
observations of faint astronomical sources are likely to be due to
zodiacal light and zodiacal emission; the induced contamination would
however be reduced by appropriate choices in the periods of observation
(part 3).},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Voyager images have revealed Amalthea to be an irregular object 270 x
165 x 150 km in size. The spin period is probably synchronous with the
orbital period of 11.9 hr, with the long axis pointing toward Jupiter.
The satellite's surface is heavily scarred by impact craters, the
largest of which has a diameter of 90 km (comparable to the mean radius
of the satellite). Amalthea is very dark (reflectance about 5-6%) and
very red, but isolated bright spots (reflectance up to 20%) occur. The
spectrum of these bright spots is less red and may show an absorption
feature near 0.6 micron. It is likely that the surface of Amalthea has
been severely altered by its environment and by contamination from Io
(especially by sulfur). It may, therefore, be very difficult to obtain
definitive information on the composition of the intrinsic Amalthea
material from remote sensing measurements.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
A system level failure could occur if the Hubble Space Telescope's
(ST) capability to operate as a facility on-orbit is critically
reduced or when a significant reduction in the quality of science
data is registered. Failure could occur if a meteoroid/debris impact
damages a component of a major support subsystem or if a
meteoroid/debris penetration causes straylight contamination in the
light shield, forward shell, aft shroud, or through the aperture
door. The ST was analyzed to find the probability of no critical
penetration. This probability value was found to be 92.25% for a
two-year service life. A straylight leakage repair technique was
recommended for the aft shroud, the region found most likely to be
critically penetrated. Fozar tape and multilayer insulation blankets
are suggested as posible repair materials.},

    Abstract = {
IUE spectra of the Herbig Ae star UX Ori reveal the presence of large
amplitude light and color changes, which are an extension to shorter
wavelengths of the "blueing" effect seen in the optical. At optical
maximum the UV spectrum of UX Ori is dominated by heavy line blanketing
from accreting circumstellar gas with velocities as high as +200km/s. At
minimum light, prominent mid-UV emission from Fe II and Mg II is
present, and the overall spectrum closely resembles spectra of more
heavily embedded Herbig Ae stars. Comparison of the UV and optical data
for UX Ori suggest that single parameter ISM-like extinction curves do
not fit the observed data near optical maximum light, when contamination
by scattered circumstellar dust is minimized. The best fit to the UV
color-magnitude diagram is for circumstellar extinction dominated by
silicate grains with a_min_>=0.15{mu}m, and with a power law
distribution n(a)=a^-2^, suggesting that both the particle size
distribution and grain chemistry in the inner disk have evolved
considerably from those characteristic of molecular clouds in the 2-3Myr
since the formation of UX Ori. },

more effective stirring of the planetseimal and ii) less effective (30 \%)

  ABSTRACT      = {
Catastrophic fracture of heterogeneous grains consisting of refractory
matrix and trapped icy inclusions is examined. As such a grain approaches
the sun after release from the comet, the saturation pressure of icy
inclusions increases, and finally exceeds the crack-extension-force
necessary for onset of unstable fast fracturing. Subsequently a growth of
cracks results in a fracture of the grain. The calculation revealed that
obsidian and magnetite grain, respectively, of radius 100 microns with 10
percent water-ice inclusions in volume suddenly disrupt near the solar
distance of 0.25 AU and of 0.6 AU. Since the small debris of fragmentation
comes from the direction of the sun on a relatively higher eccentric
orbit, this fragmentation mechanism seems favorable to explain the
beta-meteoroids observed at 1 AU.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Periodic fluctuations with time of visible polarization of Comet
Halley were found. Higher polarization occurs simultaneously in the
Lyman-alpha flash events reported by Suisei. By using the grain
model, which can give a good agreement with the observed phase angle
dependence of polarization, it is shown that in the coma within
10,000 km from the nucleus, an increase of total amount of grains by
a factor of 1.5, plus enhancement of smaller grains with radii less
than 0.1 micron by 1 order of magnitude in number, compared with
those in a quiet time, explain the simultaneous appearance of higher
polarization and brighter scattered light observed in Comet Halley
during the dust outbursts.},

The dynamics of small grains when radiation pressure forces are added
to gravitational attraction are reviewed. Mie scattering is used to
compute momentum transfer between a grain and the radiation field.
Results give the value of the ratio of radiation pressure force to
gravitational force for various materials.  The motion of a grain in
heliocentric orbit, including conditions for a particle to be ejected
from the solar system, abrupt change of the orbital elements due to
fragmentation along with continuous variation generated by
sublimation and sputtering, is discussed. Poynting-Robertson drag is
considered and results concerning the lagrangian points L4 and L5 are
given. Orbital evolution of a grain for a spherical planet is
presented. In order to make the solution relevant for planetary rings
it is adapted to allow for the planet's oblateness.},

on June 11, 1983, in Java, Indonesia. For the visual observation, a SIT
television camera, with four interference filters (5300 A, 6000 A, 7200
A and 8000 A) and a 45-deg step rotating polarizer, was used. The camera
 measured brightness distributions in a sky area of 5 x 5 deg, centered
at the eclipsed sun at each polarized position for each filter. In this
paper, a portion of these results, which are the brightness polarization
distributions in a half area of the 6000 A picture, is shown.},

    ABSTRACT     = {
There is a possible connection between structure in  planetary debris
disks and the presence of planets, our own  zodiacal cloud being one of
the prime examples. Asymmetries  in such a disk could be diagnostic of
planets which would be  otherwise undetectable. At least three different
types of  asymmetries can serve to indicate bodies orbiting a star in  a
disk: (1) a warp in the plane of symmetry of the disk due  to the
variation of the forced inclinations, I_f, with  respect to the
astrocentric distance of the particles, (2)  an offset in the center of
symmetry of the disk with respect  to the central star due to the forced
eccentricities of the  dust particles, and (3) density anomalies in the
plane of  the disk due to resonant trapping of dust particles. Dynamical
models of exo-solar system disks have been  constructed based on the
numerical integration of asteroidal  particles of a set diameter. The
dynamical evolution of the  particles is followed from source to sink
with Poynting  Robertson light drag, solar wind drag, radiation
pressure,  and the effects of forced elements produced by planetary
gravitational perturbations included. For a two planet  system, the
variation in I_f with respect to semi-major  axis, a, depends on the
mass ratio, M_1/M_2, the ratio  of the semi-major axes, a_1/a_2, and the
mutual  inclination, I_{mutual}, of the planets. We begin to
characterize the warp in two planet models by varying  M_1/M_2, a_1/a_2,
and I_{mutual}. By viewing the  integrated brightness along the line of
sight of the models  in the reference frame of an external observer for
the 24,  70, and 160 micron wave bands we can investigate to what extent
a warp in the disks could be seen by spacecraft  missions such as SIRTF.

  ABSTRACT      = {
As described by Gr\"un et al., the dust impact detector on the Ulysses
spacecraft detected a totally unexpected series of dust streams in
the outer solar system near the orbit of Jupiter. Five considerations
lead us to believe that the dust streams emanate from the jovian
system itself: the dust streams only occur within about 1 AU of the
jovian system, with the strongest stream being the one closest to
Jupiter (about 550 R(sub J) away); the direction from which they
arrive is never far from the line-of-sight direction to Jupiter; the
time period between streams is about 28 (+/- 3) days; the impact
velocities are very high--mostly around 40 km/s; and we can think of
no cometary, asteroidal, or interstellar source that could give rise
to the above four phenomena (such streams have never before been
detected).},

In models of focused interplanetary transport of solar particles, the
presence and nature of the inner boundary may play an influential role,
depending on the focusing strength of the interplanetary magnetic field.
In an exponential magnetic field, when the inner boundary is located
further in than physically reasonable, the artificial region between the
injection point and the inner boundary acts as a reservoir, focusing the
particles therein and retarding the escape of injected particles from the
inner solar system.},

It is shown here that stochastic heating can balance and indeed overwhelm
the dissipative Poynting-Robertson drag for small circumstellar dust grains.
Furthermore, the consequent drift to the outer solar system may cancel the

  ABSTRACT      = {
The brightness of the solar F-corona along the ecliptic is calculated in
the visual and near-IR spectral range, and the results are discussed
with respect to future observations. It is shown that dust particles
close to the sun have a strong influence on the corona brightness, which
enables their investigation by remote sensing experiments. Comparison of
model calculations with the observations indicates that the zodiacal
dust cloud remains mainly undisturbed up to the beginning of a dust-free
zone that amounts to about 5 solar radii. Calculations of visual
brightness and polarization indicate a change of particle properties for
a solar distance smaller than 20, which has to be proven by future
experiments. The IR F-corona brightness has contributions from solar
radiation scattered at dust particles up to wavelengths of 5 microns.
The superposition with the thermal emission of particles produces a
significant feature at the edge of the dust-free zone but the existence
of an additional dust ring cannot be supported. The observational data
at 10 microns are found to be in contradiction to the present study.},

investigations are presented to provide a basis for discussing the
results of measurements made from the Pioneer 10 spacecraft by the
asteroid meteoroid detector (AMD). The AMD detects and measures
interplanetary particles by sensing the sunlight reflected from them
as they pass through the instrument's overlapping optical
fields-of-view. The concepts and engineering characteristics of the
AMD necessary to understand the analysis of the measurements are
presented. The results and conclusions of the analysis are based on
the first in situ measurements of this type conducted in the
interplanetary region beyond the orbit of Mars. The spatial
concentration and size distribution for particulates measured by the
asteroid/meteoroid detector on Pioneer 10 between 1.0 and 3.5
astronomical units are presented.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Data in the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) Zodiacal History
File were analyzed to extract dust band locations and peak brightness
measurements from approximately 1,000 individual IRAS scans. The
study had three goals. One was to show that the prominent solar
system dust bands are associated with Hirayama asteroid families and
thus that collisions between asteroids account for a significant
fraction of the particles in the zodiacal cloud. Recent work suggests
that while the Hirayama families are a major source of the dust in
the bands, there may also be contributions from two or three smaller,
more recently recognized asteroid families. A second goal was to show
that there is evidence in the IRAS dust data for the transport of
particles from asteroid belt to the Earth by Poynting-Robertson light
drag and thus account for the fact that asteroid particles are
collected in the Earth's stratosphere. Results of the study will
confirm the location of the dust bands within the inner asteroid
belt, and show conclusively that the material seen by IRAS is now
spread over a wide range of distances from the sun. The third goal
was to construct a model of the background zodiacal cloud that
satisfies the proper dynamical constraints. Figures are provided to
show the scans processed to remove zodiacal background and Galactic
signals, and the resulting polynomial fits to the 25 micron scan. The
latter provided objective estimates of band widths, peak locations,
and peak fluxes.  Modelling and analysis of the resulting band data
has been presented at several conferences and is the subject of a
number of forthcoming papers.},

The locations and strengths of the major resonances of Saturn's known
moons with particles orbiting within Saturn's rings are calculated.
The resonant effects of an outer satellite on Saturn's rings is
analyzed by Fourier expanding the satellite's potential, and it is
found that the forcing at an l:(m-1) resonance depends on the moon's
eccentricity to the (l-m) power. As most of Saturn's inner moons are
in very nearly circular orbits, only their strongest resonances, with
l = m and l = m+1, are calculated. For Mimas, which has a somewhat
larger eccentricity, resonances with l = m+2 are also computed. All
of the resonances of these forms which are located between Saturn's
cloud tops and 2.267 Saturn radii are tabulated, except some of those
due to tiny 1980 S28.},

and the detection probability of elliptic meteoroid orbits, as well
as the pulse height distribution of the positive charge signals
released upon impacts of micrometeoroids onto the Helios sensors, and
the azimuthal distribution of impacts on both sensors. It was found
that apex particles, predominantly detected by the ecliptic sensor,
have eccentricities less than 0.4 or semimajor axes less than or
equal to 0.5 AU, while the excess of impacts on the south sensor have
orbit eccentricities greater than 0.4 and semimajor axes greater than
0.5 AU.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The lunar horizon glow observed by Apollo astronauts and recorded during
the Surveyor missions is believed to result from the scattering of
sunlight off lunar fines suspended in a dust layer above the lunar
surface. For scale heights of tens of kilometers, theory and astronaut's
observations suggest that the size of the dust particles will be smaller
than 0.1 microns in radius and will act as Rayleigh scatters. This means
that the dust scattered light will be 100 percent polarized at a 90 degree
scattering angle and will depend on wavelength to the inverse fourth power
('bluing'). Believing these signatures to be observable from ground based
telescopes, observational data in the form of CCD images has been
collected from McDonald Observatory's 36 in. telescope, and the reduction
and analysis of this data is the focus of the present report.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Charged dust orbiting through spatially periodic planetary magnetic
fields will experience time-variable electromagnetic forces. When the
forcing frequencies are nearly commensurate with the particle's
orbital frequency, the particle undergoes large out-of-plane and
radial excursions. Specific 'Lorentz' resonances, corresponding to
particular spatial periodicities in the magnetic field, occur on
either side of synchronous orbit. Lorentz resonance locations and
strengths for the Jovian and Saturnian rings are described. The
boundaries of the halo of the Jovian ring, and perhaps other ring
structures, are near resonances.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The present numerical simulations and analytic arguments show that
many of the common morphological features of the Saturn A- and B-ring
inner-edge regions are due to 'ballistic transport', or the net
radial transport of mass and angular momentum generated by exchanges
of meteoroid impact ejecta. It is suggested that the observed 100-km
undulatory structure of the inner B-ring arises from ballistic
transport echoing of the inner edge. A strongly prograde
ejecta-distribution function is used to fit the edge-region features.},

  ABSTRACT      = {The interplanetary dust cloud contains many large
(m greater than 0.001 g) meteoroids. The majority of these have orbits
that are similar to
those of their parent comets. This paper models the dust distribution
around the orbits of the 135 short-period comets that have been seen in
the inner solar system. These distributions are then integrated in a
single direction to provide a realistic indication of the way in which
the spatial density of these large meteoroids varies as a function of
the ecliptic heliocentric distance. The distribution perpendicular to
the ecliptic is also modeled. The dust cloud is found to be shaped like
a wide torus which, in the main, extends from 1.0 to 5.6 AU. The density
in the inner regions of this torus is about twice what it is in the
outer regions. The thickness of the torus is of the order of 1.2 AU.},

In January 1991, the 0.9-m Spacewatch telescope made the first observation
of an asteroid outside Earth's atmosphere but in the neighborhood of the
Earth-moon system. Since then, more than 40 Earth-approaching asteroids
have been discovered, including 13 smaller than 50 m. Using these data,
one of us has shown that there is an excess of Earth-approaching asteroids
with diameters less than 50 m, relative to the population inferred from
the distribution of larger objects. Here we argue that these smaller
objects - characterized by low eccentricities, widely ranging inclinations
and unusual spectral properties - form a previously undetected asteroid
belt concentrated near Earth. The recent discovery of additional small
Earth-approaching asteroids supports this conclusion.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
It is pointed out that significant progress can be made in
understanding asteroid collisional evolution and related phenomena by
employing laboratory experiments of collisional breakup. The targets
should have a spherical or irregular shape (up to axial ratios of the
order of 2) and should be made up of different geological materials.
It is noted that the interesting projectile velocities are of the
order of the relative velocities commonly found among asteroids, that
is, in the range 1-10 km/s. To obtain catastrophic collisions, the
ratio of the projectile's kinetic energy to the target's mass must be
chosen within a 'critical' range. A summary is given of the
experimental work that needs to be done to refine knowledge on the
collisional evolution of asteroids and on asteroid rotation rates,
shapes, dynamic families, and spectro-photometric properties.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
A variety of physical processes can erode the surfaces of planetary
ring particles. According to current estimates, the most efficient of
these over the bulk of Saturn's rings is hypervelocity impact by 100
microns to one centimeter radius meteoroids. The atoms, molecules,
and fragments ejected from ring particles by erosion arc across the
rings along elliptical orbits to produce a tenuous halo of solid
ejecta and an extensive gaseous atmosphere. Continuous exchange of
ejecta between different ring regions can lead to net radial
transport of mass and angular momentum. The equations governing this
ballistic transport process are presented and discussed. Both
numerical and analytic studies of idealized ring systems illustrate
that ballistic transport can cause significant mass redistribution in
the rings, especially near regions of high density contrast, such as
the inner edges of the A and B rings. Ejecta exchanges can also alter
local particle sizes and compositions and may produce pulverized
regoliths at least several centimeters deep. The meteoroid erosion
rate is so high that significant global torques and mass loss are
possible on times shorter than a solar system life time.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Submicrometer- to micrometer-sized particles were recorded by the
Ulysses dust detector within 40 days of the Jupiter flyby. Nine
impacts were recorded within 50 Jupiter radii with most of them
recorded after closest approach. Three of these impacts are
consistent with particles on prograde orbits around Jupiter and the
rest are believed to have resulted from gravitationally focused
interplanetary dust. From the ratio of the impact rate before the
Jupiter flyby to the impact rate after the Jupiter flyby it is
concluded that interplanetary dust particles at the distance of
Jupiter move on mostly retrograde orbits. On 10 March 1992, Ulysses
passed through an intense dust stream. The dust detector recorded 126
impacts within 26 hours. The stream particles were moving on highly
inclined and apparently hyperbolic orbits with perihelion distances
of greater than 5 astronomical units. Interplanetary dust is lost
rather quickly from the solar system through collisions and other
mechanisms and must be almost continuously replenished to maintain
observed abundances. Dust flux measurements, therefore, give evidence
of the recent rates of production from sources such as comets,
asteroids, and moons, as well as the possible presence of
interstellar grains.},

The sputtering of a small grain embedded in a plasma or hot gas, process
relevant in both circumstellar and planetary environments, is modeled using
a binary collision code. The Monte Carlo technique is used to describe the
transport of the atoms set in motion in the solid by an incident ion, and
the sputtering from the surface of a grain induced by collisional cascades.
This method can be directly applied to
erosion of circumstellar, predominantly carbon and silicate grains, by
low-energy C and H shock waves. It is shown that such grains erode much more
rapidly than previously assumed, and that an order-of-magnitude increase in
the erosion rate can occur for very small grains. On the other hand,
water-ice grains, common in planetary magnetospheres, are more difficult to
model since the sputtering from ice is mainly electron-induced. Here we
present a model for water-ice, calibrated to the laboratory sputtering, and
describing the enhancement in the yield due to erosion from the edges and
back surfaces. We show that erosion rate increases substantially when the
ion penetration depth becomes comparable to the grain radius. The grain size
effect manifests itself even when the grain radius is several times larger
than the mean penetration depth of the incident particle. Therefore, for the
ions not energetic enough to completely penetrate through the grain, the
transport of recoils leads to enhanced erosion from the sides of a grain
significantly shortening their lifetime. In the case of the E-Ring our
calculations show that energetic keV ions rapidly erode submicron grains
giving a possible explanation for narrow particle size distribution of the
Saturnian E-ring.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The production of fast oxygen atoms in the Martian exosphere as a
result of the electron dissociative recombination of O2(+) ions is
reevaluated for the time period appropriate to the Phobos 2 mission.
Because of the prevalent condition of solar maximum activities in
1989, both the upper atmosphere and ionsphere should have more
extended structures than those encountered during the Viking Orbiter
(VO) mission in 1976 which was near solar minimum. The distributions
of the hot oxygen atoms are compared for these different levels of
solar activities and it is found that the number density of the hot
oxygen atoms during the Phobos 2 mission should be a factor of two
larger than estimated for the time period VO mission. The nonthermal
escape rate of the exospheric oxygen atoms is thus comparable to the
ionospheric escape rate measured in the Martian magnetotail.
Furthermore, the flux of the oxygen ions picked up in the hot atomic
corona should be more intense than previously thought.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
   During the July 31, 1981 eclipse, F-corona interferograms were obtained
   near the 5184-A Mg I line covering the 3-7 solar radius region. A
   Fabry-Perot etalon in the exit pupil and a contact fiber-optic
   intensifier were used, the instrumental FWHM being 0.5 A = about 30
   km/s. Radial velocities of interplanetary dust were obtained measuring
   Doppler shift of absorption lines. A prograde Keplerian velocity
   component was found, giving after averaging Vr = (5.4 + or - 0.7)R/solar
   radius + (5 + or - 4) km/s, as well as a retrograde motion. At 6-7 solar
   radius near the north coronal hole, a local stream with Vr = +130 km/s
   was observed. Although at large distances from the sun the sky
   brightness exceeds that of the F-corona, absorption lines are absent, so
   the sky brightness continuous component is predominant, and the K-corona
   scattered light may be its main source.},

An upper limit to the optical depth of the Jovian ring at high

about 13 km in Jupiter's equatorial plane by the projection of the
Fresnel zone on the equatorial plane in the radial direction. At this
resolution, the normal optical depth limit is about 0.008. This limit
applies to a strip in the Jovian equatorial plane that crosses the
orbits of Amalthea, 1979J1, 1979J3, and the ring. An upper limit on
the number density of kilometer-size boulders has been set at one per
11.000 sq km in the equatorial plane.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Three wide-angle photographs with a field diameter of 140 deg are used to
derive upper limits for the surface brightness and dust density of the
hypothetical libration cloud at the L4 Lagrangian point in the earth-moon
system. A region of 40 by 9.2 deg along the moon's orbit and centered on
L4 was scanned with a digitized microdensitometer, and the gegenschein was
scanned perpendicular to the ecliptic in an area of 4.6 by 20 deg. The
results show no clear increase or decrease in brightness around L4 and a
second-order variation of only 10 S sub 10 in the brightness of the
zodiacal band. Analysis of the scatter in surface brightness per sq deg
about the mean indicates that the upper limit for the surface brightness
of the hypothetical cloud should be less than 3 S sub 10 and that this
excess brightness corresponds to a dust density that is four times greater
than the interplanetary average.},

established from limb-coordinate data. Attention is given to the
shape's significance for Tethys' internal structure. It is
alternatively concluded that Tethys is either differentiated, and
possesses a small rocky core, or has been interpreted as possessing a
mass that is too low by about 15 percent.}

The cases when the spacecraft Phobos 2 was inside the expected tails

for the magnetic field draping around the Mars moons are observed.
The interaction of the solar wind with Phobos and Deimos may be
similar to the interaction with a small comet. The wake effects
downstream from Phobos (Deimos) inside the Martian magnetosphere are
seen as well.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Within 1 AU from Jupiter, the dust detector aboard the Ulysses
spacecraft during the flyby on February 8, 1992 recorded periodic
bursts of submicron dust particles with durations ranging from
several hours to two days and occurring at about monthly intervals.
These particles arrived at Ulysses in collimate streams radiating
from close to the line-of-sight direction to Jupiter, suggesting a
Jovian origin for the periodic bursts.  Ulysses also detected a flux
of micron-sized dust particles moving in high-velocity retrograde
orbits. These grains are identified here as being of interstellar
origin.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
During the July 31, 1981 solar eclipse, F-corona interferograms near Mg
I 5184 A were obtained using a Fabry-Perot etalon with an FWHM of 0.5 A
(corresponding to 30 km/sec) and an image tube. Radial velocities V(r)
of the interplanetary dust (ID) were measured in different directions.
Both prograde and retrograde motions of ID in the ecliptic region is
discovered. Most of velocity values do not exceed 50 km/sec. A negative
velocity component appears after averaging all V(r) for all directions.
Its average increases to -20 km/sec toward the sun. Some ejections are
observed. The strongest (+130 km/sec) is located at the north ecliptic
pole at a distance of 6 to 7 solar radii. From the lack of unshifted
Fraunhofer lines in the scattered sky light, it is concluded that the
sky brigntness continuous component is predominant and its source is
K-corona scattered light in the earth's atmosphere.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The micrometeoroid experiment on board of Helios 1 makes it possible
to study micrometeoroids at heliocentric distances of less than 0.75
AU. Such studies are of special interest in connection with a
prediction made by Briggs (1962), according to which the spatial
density of dust particles should increase close to the sun because of
the Poynting-Robertson effect. The considered experiment measures the
impact of individual dust particles. The design of the employed
instrument and its principles of operation are described and aspects
of impact identification are discussed. The radial variation of the
observed impact rate is illustrated with the aid of a graph. Other
graphs show the pulse height distribution of the ion charge released
upon impact and the azimuthal distribution of the impacts.},

A simple 'perturbed pendulum' model is developed in order to
ascertain the origin and dynamics of the secondary resonances in the
tidal evolution of Miranda and Umbriel through the 1:3 mean motion
commensurability. Long-term evolution is addressed on the basis of
the computation-accelerating method of algebraic mappings. It is
found that the present 4.34-deg value of Miranda's orbital
inclination is probably a result of capture into the primary
resonance, as well as subsequent capture into the 3/1 secondary
resonance. The damping of an eccentricity as high as 0.035 by tidal
dissipation in the satellite may account for the surface features of
Miranda.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Beta Pictoris ({beta} Pic) is the best studied of the normal
main-sequence stars surrounded by circumstellar dust disks. We review
the status of {beta} Pic and its disk, and compare it with both the
early and the present Solar System. The disk has very little gas and
therefore is more evolved and older than the primordial solar nebulae,
which persists for 1--10 Myr. We concentrate on the observed optical
properties, spatial and size distribution, mineralogy, and physics of
the dust component, all of which are similar, if not identical, to those
of the interplanetary and cometary dust in the Solar System. The most
important process in the disk is collisional fragmentation of orbiting
solid bodies, leading to the eventual removal of micron-sized and
smaller debris from the system by radiation pressure. Silicate dust and
sand, as well as planetesimals (perhaps comets) are observed around the
star in quantities that are orders of magnitude larger than those in the
present Solar System, but are consistent with a young Solar System in
the clearing stage. Theory of the {beta} Pic disk indicates that its age
must be (100 Myr, and its mass comparable with that of all solid bodies
in our system. Several indirect arguments support the hypothetical
existence of planet(s) in orbit around the star. Our current knowledge
strongly suggests a positive answer to the title question.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
In 1967, Lunar Explorer 35 was launched from the earth and placed into a
stable orbit around the moon.  The data from the dust particle experiment
on this spacecraft were essentially continuous over a 5-yr period from the
time of insertion in lunar orbit. Analysis of this data has been
interpreted to show that micron-sized lunar ejecta leave the moon and
traverse through selenocentric and cislunar space and obtain either
interplanetary/heliocentric orbits or intercept the earth's magnetosphere
and move into geocentric orbits. Extensive studies of the orbital
trajectories of lunar particles in this size range have now been conducted
that include a calculation of the solar radiation force using the full Mie
scattering theory.  A significant flux of particles with radii less than
0.1 micron are found to intercept the earth's magnetopause surface. This
flux is shown to be strongly dependent upon both the particle's density
and its index of refraction.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The chief difficulties in interpreting the geometry of the IRAS solar
system dust bands are (1) the geocentric viewpoint of the IRAS
telescope and (2) the large range of elongation angles sampled by
IRAS. To overcome these and other difficulties a three-dimensional
numerical model is constructed that permits the calculation of the
latitudinal distribution of the thermal flux that would be received
at the earth from any particular distribution of dust particle
orbits. The model includes the effects of planetary perturbations on
the dust particle orbits, reproduces the exact viewing geometry of
the IRAS telescope, and allows for the eccentricity of the earth's
orbit. The result is a model for the variation with ecliptic latitude
of the brightness observed in a given waveband as the line of sight
of the telescope sweeps through the model dustband at a constant
elongation angle.},

Single dust particle dynamics in a plasma Debye sheath near the surface of
solid bodies in space is examined. The electric field and the equilibrium
charge of a dust particle are computed as functions of position in the
sheath. The position where the electric force on a dust particle at charge
equilibrium balances the gravitational force is found. The charge delay of
a moving dust particle is taken into account by numerical solution of the
equation of motion and by solving the linearized equation of motion.
Circumstances under which dust particles ejected from the surface will be
'floated' and come to rest in the sheath are determined, and possible dust
sources for the sheath are discussed.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
We have shown that most of the observed properties of this region
(radial extent 3-8 R Sat., vertical extent 6000 - 40000 km with a
minima at the orbit of Enceladus and a size distribution that sharply
peaks at around 1 mu in grain radius) are due to magnetospheric
effects (Horanyi et al, Icarus 97, 248, 1992). The orbital precession
rates caused by Saturns' oblateness and the Lorentz force on grains ~
1 mu in radius were shown to be approximately equal in magnitude but
opposite in sign at Enceladus' distance. This near cancellation
allows solar radiation pressure to induce large periodic changes in
the orbital eccentricity of these particles. The charge to mass ratio
of smaller or bigger grains will not result in a cancellation of
their precession rates and these grains will not spread as swiftly as
1 mu sized particles do. These ideas were developed further to
account for the other moons as possible sources due to the
self-generation of dust from the impacts of high velocity E-ring
particles onto these moons themselves (Hamilton and Burns, Science
264, 550, 1994).

However, the expected secondary peaks in brightness due to the
contribution of the moons other than Enceladus - owing to bombardment
by interplanetary micro-meteorites and/or the self-supporting
mechanism - were not seen in the recent HST edge-on observations
(Nicholson et al, Science 272, 509, 1996).

Here we present our most recent E-ring simulation results based on
the best available 3D plasma model of the region (Richardson, GRL 22,
1177, 1995). The simulations yield an improved match with the
observed radial and vertical distribution of the grains assuming
Enceladus to be the only important source of dust particles. This
indicates that Enceladus does have special surface properties,
compared to the other nearby moons, with a much higher dust
production yield and/or Enceladus itself is active producing dust
particles.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The zodiacal dust cloud's mass loss rate, which is an important
factor in the consideration of its steady state, has in the past been
indirectly estimated on the basis of the inward mass flux of
interplanetary grains at 1 AU. The rate is presently investigated on
the basis of direct calculations of the orbital behavior of
circumsolar dust grains undergoing sublimation. It is found that the
solar dust ring located at 4 solar radii from the sun, which consists
of grains whose Poynting-Robertson effect inward spiraling is stopped
by the influence of sublimation, loses its mass at a rate of 0.35-3.5
tons/sec.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
An analysis is performed which shows that the micrometeoroid groups
observed by the HEOS 2 satellite could have been produced by ejections
from the lunar surface during primary impacts by meteorites. A simplified
physical model is used to evaluate the distribution of secondary particles
resulting from the impact of a meteorite on the lunar surface. The number,
density, and approximate dimensions of clouds of secondary particles
produced by such an impact are estimated along with the expected number of
clouds intercepted by HEOS 2, the conditional probability that the
satellite sensor will encounter a certain number of particles belonging to
the same cloud, and the expected number of events. The results obtained
indicate that secondary ejecta from primary objects with a mass of 1 kg or
more constitute a possible origin for the particle groups observed by HEOS
2. It is noted that the calculated results are in order-of-magnitude
agreement with the observations.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Ways in which dust may be ejected from the vicinity of Jupiter are
described. It is argued that the masses and velocities of detected
particles of periodic, collimated streams of high-velocity,
submicrometer-sized dust particles are best explained by an origin in
Jupiter's gossamer ring. Following their ejection from the
magnetosphere, the dust particles are accelerated by the IMF. It is
the temporal evolution of the IMF which primarily determines the
particle trajectories, and hence which particles reach the
spacecraft. The present model explains the following three features
observed in the Ulysses mission data: fewer streams are detected
before the closest approach than after, the observed periodicity is
closely related to the solar rotation period, and an extremely
intense dust stream is detected immediately after the closest
approach.},

Analysis of IRAS data of the thermal zodiacal emission reveals an

  ABSTRACT      = {
The current knowledge of the dynamics and structure of the Uranian
rings is reviewed, with an emphasis on the observations that have
allowed the determination of accurate ring orbits and detailed radial
structure. It is shown that several of the Uranian ring orbits have a
close connection with two small satellites, providing strong evidence
for ring confinement by shepherds. Some tentative conclusions
concerning particle size and the vertical structure of the rings are
drawn from a quantitative study of optical depth variations with
wavelength and orbital phase. Ring structure is examined; the rings
are found to be remarkably diverse in their radial structure and
azimuthal variations. The central elements of the dynamics of
shepherding as currently understood, and tempered by observational
constraints, is presented. A selection of open questions and
prospects for future progress is provided.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Charged dust grains orbiting around the sun at heliocentric latitudes
less than 15 deg are submitted to a random Lorentz force due to
recurrent sectors of the interplanetary magnetic field and
high-speed-streams of the solar wind. Using a formalism previously
developed (Barge et al., 1982) the problem is reinvestigated and leads
to a detailed description of the scattering process. The changes in the
orbital elements are estimated for a time scale of 10 yr; they are found
to be less important than believed until now and to vary rapidly with
eccentricity and semi-major-axis. Only the very small dielectric dust
grains, with size less than 0.5 micron, may be scattered by the Lorentz
force fluctuations; the main diffusion occurs in inclination and near
the sun (20-60 solar radii).},

A theory for Hyperion is developed in which the perturbations by Titan
have been developed synthetically. These perturbations were derived by
fitting a sum of periodic terms to the numerical integration of Sinclair
and Taylor (1985) extended to +/- 25 yr from the epoch used, 1973.87. A
theory for Hyperion, constructed by adding the solar perturbations to
the synthetic theory and including expressions for the motion of the
orbit plane, was, together with the theories for the other major
satellites of Saturn fitted to observations from 1967 to 1983.},

The motion of a particle orbiting a planet is investigated when both
the gravitational attraction of the planet and the radial radiation
force due to the sun are taken into account. Because of this latter
force, a rotating frame is introduced so as to maintain the sun at
fixed coordinates. It is established that the secular problem, which
has two degrees of freedom, is completely integrable and that it
possesses only periodical solutions.  An explicit analytical solution
is provided.},

Perturbation equations for the motions of weakly charged dust grains
in planetary rings are derived, with emphasis on the Jovian ring
system, and the nature of the trajectories at various locations
within the ring system are studied in depth. The analytical results
are tested against numerical integrations of the full equations of
motion. The overall ring topology is predicted by averaging over
large numbers of grains, and the results are compared with Voyager
images. It is shown how electromagnetic forces can create ring
boundaries and vertical warping of the ring plane, as well as account
both for the enhanced vertical thickness of the halo relative to the
main ring and for radial structure within the main ring itself. The
successful and unsuccessful predictions of the model concerning the
Jovian ring system are discussed.},

The dynamics of small dust grains ejected from the Martian satellites
is investigated, considering both the solar radiation perturbation
and electromagnetic forces since the grains move in a magnetized
plasma.  Lorentz forces can dramatically change the nature of the
trajectories, resulting in, for example, prolonged lifetimes for
submicron-sized grains moving through an idealized model. It is
suggested that a permanent, nonuniform and time-dependent dust halo
of grains predominantly around 0.1 micron may exist about Mars.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The ring models described here were developed to account for the
dynamical problems posed by the narrow rings of Uranus. Some of these
rings are now known to be eccentric, inclined, nonuniform in width,
optically thick, and narrow, with very sharp edges. The eccentric
rings have common pericenters and large, positive eccentricity
gradients. The theory of shepherding satellites successfully accounts
for most of these features and can also account for some features of
the narrow Saturnian rings, in particular, waves, kinks, and periodic
variations in brightness. Outstanding problems include the putative
relation between eccentricity and inclination displayed by eight of
the nine Uranian rings, and the magnitudes of the tidal torques
acting on the shepherding satellites. The horseshoe-orbit model,
although viable, probably has more application to the narrow rings
from which the Saturnian coorbital satellites formed. The angular
momentum flow rate due to particle collisions is a minimum at the
Lagrangian equilibrium points L(4) and L(5), and one can expect
accretion to be rapid at these points.},

Effects of a resonance between a set of ring particles and individual
satellites are considered. It is suggested that the resonances are
1:1 for the rings of Uranus and that each ring must contain an as-yet
unseen satellite. A model is proposed in which the rings of Uranus
were caused by small satellites that entered the Roche zone due to
tidal drag. According to this model, the satellites gradually lost
material from their surfaces in this zone, the particles left a
satellite with relatively low speeds and must have entered orbits
similar to that of the satellite, and the gravitational force of the
satellite compelled these particles to remain in a narrow sharply
defined ring.},

was trapped in orbit around the earth.  Poincare had previously pointed

inelastic, a cloud of this kind would organize itself as a ring or a set

  ABSTRACT      = {
The equations describing the change in orbital elements of
interplanetary dust due to Lorentz-force accelerations are presented in
a simplified form. Such accelerations depend on the charge state of the
dust; results of theoretical calculations for five possible dust
materials are presented. Under present-day conditions, it is possible
that semiconducting material such as graphite might carry a net voltage
near zero, compared with a roughly 10-V charge expected for other
grains. The scattering of dust by a randomly changing magnetic field can
be viewed analogously to the dust diffusing in space; the equations
presented thus can be used to interpret observations of the present
distribution of dust in terms of its possible sources and sinks. The
stronger magnetic fields of the early solar system would have led to
more vigorous scattering of the dust; particles as large as 1 mm could
have been significantly transported by Lorentz scattering during this
time.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The optical properties of dust aggregates are investigated using the
discrete dipole approximation, replacing each constituent particle by
a dipole. Two extreme types of dust aggregate whose number of
constituent particles is 256, 512, and 1024 respectively are treated
in order to show how the optical properties depend on structure and
size of the aggregates and on the chemical composition of the
constituent particles. Below a critical wavelength, the aggregates
are found to behave as dipoles. The behavior of the scattering cross
sections around the critical wavelength is a diagnostic for the size
of dust aggregates regardless of the chemical composition. The
wavelength dependence of the absorption cross sessions is explained
in terms of the optical thickness of the aggregates and is reasonably
reproduced by a simple formula.}

  ABSTRACT      = {
Results of the Micrometeoroid Detector and Zodiacal Light Experiment
published or directly provided by the Helios-Investigators were used
in an effort of cooperative interpretation. Analysis of orbital
elements derived from impacts led to low inclination orbits for
larger and mainly hyperbolic trajectories of smaller micrometeorites,
both with negligible percentage of retrograde cases. Radiation
pressure, energy budget, and the orbits of dust particles evaporating
near the Sun were investigated, taking into account the effects of
size variation. It was found, that there is no appreciable production
of Beta-meteoroids by evaporation, since in most cases this effect
leads to total destruction faster than the particle can escape by
radiation pressure. Scattering properties of irregular, fluffy and
meteoritic particles were investigated by calculations, microwave and
laser scattering experiments.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
It is believed that a small solid grain in space has an electrostatic
potential on its surface. The reported study has the objective to
reexamine the physical processes governing the electrostatic
potential of a grain in interplanetary space. The electrostatic
potential of a grain is estimated as a function of grain radius and
solar distance. Attention is given to collisions of charged
particles, photoelectron emission under solar irradiation, and the
electric potential of an interplanetary grain. It is found that
several secondary electrons are emitted when an electron with an
energy of about 130 eV impinges on a graphite or a silicate grain.
This implies that for both materials the incidence of a high-energy
electron causes a decrease of negative charge on the grain surface
until the grain attains enough positive potential to prevent this
emission of secondary electrons.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The beta Pictoris circumstellar disk, like others, seems to exhibit an
inner clearing zone, at typical distances of 1-50 AU from the star. We
investigate the possibility that this void is caused by a planet
embedded in the disk. We have implemented on a Connection Machine a code
which simultaneously integrates the motions of 8192 particles. These are
submitted to Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag, while being perturbed by a
planet orbiting at 20 AU from the star. The free parameters are the
planetary mass, the planetary orbital eccentricity, and the particle
size. Above a critical planet mass of approximately 10(exp -5) stellar
masses (approximately 5 Earth masses, or 1/3 Uranian masses), the planet
is able to trap particles in outer mean motion resonaces, for time
scales comparable to, or larger than, the PR decay time. No permanent
trapping is observed, however. Once they escape the resonances, the
particles rapidly decay onto the star, on highly eccentric orbits. A
moderate planetary orbital eccentricity 10(exp -2) can create large
arclike structures in the disk. A depleted region corotating with the
planet, and just outside it, is also observed. We show finally that
these processes can create a steady state clearing zone extending inside
the planet orbit. We emphasize that the structures excited on the disk
by a planet could be a way to reveal bodies otherwise invisible by
direct imagery. },

  ABSTRACT      = {
Catastrophic fragmentation of the ring moons of Uranus and
Neptune occurs in approximately 10 exp 8 years. The fate of the
debris following a fragmenting impact is central to
understanding the evolution of these satellites and the
hypothesized origin of rings from their debris. In this paper
the possible effects of the velocity distribution of fragments
following a catastrophic fragmentation on satellite diminution
via a collisional cascade is examined. Fragment velocities are
critical in the evolution of the collisional cascade because of
the possibility of reaccretion following disruption. The
fragment velocity distribution is used to calculate the initial
phase space distribution of the new ring particles. This
provides a physically realistic initial condition for
simulations of the collisional evolution of planetary rings.},

    ABSTRACT  = {
The Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt contains a population of objects ~10^3 times that
of the main asteroid belt, spread over a volume ~10^3 larger and with
relative speeds ~10 times lower. As for the asteroids, the size distribution
of Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt objects has been modified by mutual impacts over
Solar System history. We have modeled this collisional evolution process
using a numerical code developed originally to study asteroid collisional
evolution but modified to reflect collision rates in the Edgeworth-Kuiper
Belt. Our numerical simulations show that collisional evolution is
substantial in the inner part of the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt, but its
intensity decreases with increasing distance from the Sun. In the inner
belt, objects with diameters D > 50-100 km are not depleted by disruptive
collisions; hence they reflect the original (formative) population (many of
them, however, may have been converted into ``rubble piles''). On the other
hand, smaller objects are mostly multigenerational fragments, although the
original population must have contained a significant number of bodies down
to at least a few tens of kilometers in size in order to initiate a
collisional cascade. About 10 fragments, 1-10 km in size, are produced per
year in the inner Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt, with a few percent of them inserted
into chaotic resonant orbits. This is in rough agreement with the required
influx rate of Jupiter-family comets. Both collisions and dynamical
instabilities associated with resonances are processes that can inject
comets into the ``escape hatches,'' but our results indicate that most
comets coming from the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt would be fragments from larger
parent bodies, rather than primitive planetesimals. However, this does not
apply to Chiron-sized (D > 100 km) objects, which must be primordial and
delivered to the outer Solar System by either dynamical processes or
nondisruptive collisions.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Saturn's broad E ring, the narrow G ring, and the structured and
apparently time-variable F ring(s) contain many micron and
submicron-sized particles, which make up the 'visible' component. These
rings (or ring systems) are in direct contact with magnetospheric
plasma. Fluctuations in the plasma density and/or mean energy, due to
magnetospheric and solar wind processes, may induce stochastic charge
variations on the dust particles, which in turn lead to an orbit
perturbation and spatial diffusion. In addition, Coulomb drag forces may
be important, in particular for the E ring. The possibility that
electromagnetic effects may play a role in determining the F ring
structure and its possible time variations is critically examined.
Sputtering of micron-sized dust particles in the E ring by
magnetospheric ions yields lifetimes of 100 to 10,000 years. This effect
as well as the plasma induced transport processes require an active
source for the E ring, probably Enceladus.

    ABSTRACT  = {
We have calculated a simple model of the expected Kuiper Belt (KB) small
grain population and the thermal emission that would arise from such grains.
We have also sought observational evidence for this emission. The model
assumed equilibrium between grain creation by collisional fragmentation of
comets and removal by Poynting-Robertson radiation drag, radiation
pressure--driven ejection, mutual collisions, and sublimation. The model
far-IR intensity scales as the square of total KB mass. Comparison of our
model with observations of the zodiacal dust rules out emission from
trans-Neptunian dust representing more than about 0.3 M_{&oplus;} of KB
comets. This agrees with recent HST reports of a population of comet-sized
bodies in the KB which has a minimum mass of about 0.04 M_{&oplus;} ,
although that population can be extrapolated to include as much as 1
M_{&oplus;} in the volume of our model. The model KB dust fractional
bolometric luminosity (Ldust/Lstar) would have about 10-2 and 10-4 of the
values for the grain disks around Vega and beta Pic, respectively. A
preliminary search in COBE DIRBE data reveals nonuniform bands near the
ecliptic of cold (T = 20--30 K) emission prominent at wavelengths of 140 and
240 mu m but not prominent relative to zodiacal emission at shorter (IRAS)
wavelengths. Most of this emission is probably not from solar system
material.

The detection of particles near the rings of Saturn by the meteoroid
detection instrument on board Pioneer 11 is discussed. The instrument
consists of 234 penetration detectors, distributed between two
independent data channels each of which is designed to become
inhibited for a period of 77 min after the registration of a
penetration event in that channel. At least four particles penetrated
the detectors in the 4.5 h period around Saturn periapsis at radial
distances between 1.36 and 3.1 Saturn radii, a radial distribution
inconsistent with the gravitational focusing of meteoroids. The
detection of particles which may have been part of the E ring before
the crossing of the ring plane suggests that this ring may be 1800 km
thick, with an optical thickness greater than 10 to the -8th.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The lunar horizon glow observed by Apollo astronauts and captured on film
during the Surveyor mission is believed to result from the scattering of
sunlight off lunar fines suspended in a dust layer over the lunar surface.
For scale heights on the order of tens of kilometers, it is anticipated
that the size of the dust particles will be small enough to admit Rayleigh
scattering. Such events would result in scattered light which is polarized
to a degree which is a function of observation angle and produce spectra
containing large high frequency components ('bluing'). Believing these
signatures to be observable from ground based telescopes, observational
data has been collected from McDonald Observatory and the task of
reduction and analysis of this data is the focus of the present report.},

An interpretation of the observed size distribution function of

power law behavior and its exponent can be explained. Moreover, with
some general assumptions about the nucleus the dust-ice mixing ratio

  ABSTRACT      = {
Data on the magnetosphere of Saturn obtained with the trapped radiation
detector package on board the Pioneer 11 spacecraft is reported. Radiation
belt profiles determined by the trapped radiation detectors on Pioneer 10
and 11 indicate that Saturn's magnetosphere is intermediate in size
between those of the earth and Jupiter, with particle intensities similar
to those of the earth. The outer region of the Saturn magnetosphere is
found to contain particles of lower energy than the outer region, being
strongly influenced by the time-varying solar wind. The moons and rings of
Saturn are observed to be effective absorbers of trapped particles,
confirming the discoveries of the F ring, the Pioneer ring division and
the moon 1979 S 2.  Particle diffusion rates are used to estimate a
cross-sectional area of greater than 7 x 10 to the 13th sq cm and an
opacity greater than 0.00001 for the F ring. It is suggested that
cosmic-ray albedo neutron decay be studied as a possible source of
energetic particles in the inner magnetosphere of Saturn.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
An overview of three uncommon trajectory concepts for space missions in
the Sun-Earth-Moon System is presented. One concept uses a special class
of libration-point orbits called 'halo orbits.' It is shown that members
of this orbit family are advantageous for monitoring the solar wind input
to the Earth's magnetosphere, and could also be used to establish a
continuous communications link between the Earth and the far side of the
Moon. The second concept employs pretzel-like trajectories to explore the
Earth's geomagnetic tail. These trajectories are formed by using the Moon
to carry out a prescribed sequence of gravity-assist maneuvers. Finally,
there is the 'boomerang' trajectory technique for multiple-encounter
missions to comets and asteroids. In this plan, Earth-swingby maneuvers
are used to retarget the original spacecraft trajectory. The boomerang
method could be used to produce a triple-encounter sequence which includes
flybys of comets Halley and Tempel-2 as well as the asteroid Geographos.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
 New high resolution mid-infrared images of the inner part of the beta
Pictoris circumstellar dust disk are reported. These data are used to
probe the inner disk geometry and to derive the 0-100 AU radial density
profile, with a spatial resolution of 5 AU. Realistic grains (porous
silicates with a core of olivine and pyroxene coated with a mantle
``organic refractories'') rather than solid Draine and Lee silicates,
have been incorporated in models describing the dust thermal emission.
In a first set of models, we assume a single composition for the grains.
These models are not able to fully reproduce simultaneously our data and
the IRAS fluxes. In a second set of models, we introduce another
component, consisting of particles containing some ice beyond a limit
around 90-100 AU. Such a model fulfils all the observational constraints
(including the visible scattered flux) and resolves the discrepancy
concerning the particles albedo which is predicted to be too small in
the first set of models. It also predicts an ice feature at 50 mu m; a
feature around 6 mu m characteristic of the organic refractory material;
and several crystalline olivine features at 24, 28 and 35 mu m. These
features should be observable with the Short Wavelength Spectrometer
(SWS) and Long Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS) on board the Infrared Space
Observatory. 20 mu m images should also show an abrupt cut-off around
90-100 AU due to the change of the grains composition. ISOCAM should
image essentially the scattered starlight, showing the transition
between the thermal emission of the inner, non-icy, component, and the
scattered emission in the mid-infrared range from the outer component
containing ice.

  ABSTRACT      = {
A model is employed to simulate the processes involved in the
structuring of the nitrogen gas torus of two planetary satellites.
The model analytically describes: (1) the vertical profile of the
production rate of the atomic nitrogen fragments; (2) the exothermic
energy spectra; and (3) the collisional thermalization effect.  The
density of N atoms in the gas ring near Titan's orbit is estimated to
be 3-20 atoms/cu cm with smaller densities at other parts of the
magnetosphere. The peak density near Triton's orbit is shown to be
about 10-20 atoms/cu cm. The simplified model shows that electron
impact and the atmospheric depth of energy deposition by the
magnetospheric electronslimit the launch of suprathermal N atoms into
circumplanetary orbits.},

Inclusion of fragmentation caused a kind of self-regulation in favour of the
runaway growth of planetary embryos. Scenario:
stochastically some larger seeds evolve -- getting runaway embryos. Dynamical
friction dampes them and also bigger planetesimals - latter evolved by fewer
mutual collision. As a balance the original remainder are heated up - they do
not strongly contribute to the runaway because of the reduced Safronov
number (high thermal velocities). However, the higher the velocities the
higher the fragmentation probabilities become. Fragments are strongly damped
due to gas drag. The embryos grow further much faster and heat also up the
large planetesimals of class 2 (in mass). This leads to a decrease of feeding
the embryos by them. The embryos "eat" smaller low velocity debris at time.
Further dyanmical heating of class 2 planetesimals lead also to fragmentation
==> increased damping ==> increased feeding rate a.s.o.a.s.f.
==> Fragmentation keeps the runaway going and avoids its stopping
I realized that they did not include a "damping" outcome of the
catastrophic fragmentation
in random velocities. The energy needed to fracture the colliders should result
in - at least - finally in a much lower amount of kinetic energy.}

  ABSTRACT      = {
The micrometeoroid experiment on board Helios makes possible the
in-situ detection of interplanetary dust particles. The experiment
consists of two sensors which are inclined differently with respect
to the equatorial plane of the spacecraft. It is based on the plasma
production resulting from the impact of fast particles (V or=1
Km/sec) on a solid target. The instrument characteristics are
discussed. Micrometeoroids are measured in the mass range from (10 to
the -16) g to (10 to the -8)g and in the speed range from 2 km/sec to
50 km/sec. Additionally, the direction of impact is determined with
an accuracy of + or - 60 deg.  The particle charge is measured in the
range from (10 to the - 14) to (10 to the -12) Coulomb. The ion
composition of the impact plasma is mass analyzed with a time of
flight spectrometer in the range 15 to 70 amu. The mass resolution is
M/Delta M approximately 10.},

    ABSTRACT  = {
The cometary activity of Chiron inspires us to investigate observable
lifetimes of hypothetical dust particles around large, distant Centaur and
Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs). Our model computes dust particle trajectories
assuming comet nucleus gravity, solar gravity, and solar radiation pressure.
We find that particle lifetimes are extremely sensitive to the magnitude of
the initial velocity. Long-lived orbits require an exact combination of
nucleus size, heliocentric distance, particle size, and initial velocity.
Estimating ejection velocities due to CO sublimation, we find that particles
escape >50,000 km from Centaurs in <~6 days and from KBOs in <~10 days.
Assuming optimal ejection velocities < v_escape, upper limits to bound coma
lifetimes are 50-75 days for Centaurs with Chiron-like activity. Thus
Chiron's long-lived coma cannot be a result of an outburst. To observe a KBO
coma requires a massive ~5 x 10^9-kg dust coma, and its lifetime varies from
<2 months to ~1 year depending on object size and heliocentric distance.

  ABSTRACT      = {
Part of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) tray allocated to
French experiments, known as FRECOPA payload, was devoted to the study of
dust particles. Two passive experiments were flown: one composed of a set
of glass and metallic samples and one composed of multilayer thin foils
detectors.  In addition to these experiments, a broad variety of materials
were exposed to the bombardment of microparticles and provide more data.
Thick target experiment comprises selected metallic (Al, Au, Cu, W,
Stainless Steel) 250 microns thick and glass surfaces 1.5 mm thick. Crater
size distribution from these thick target experiments enable, with the aid
of lab calibrations by solid particle accelerators, the evaluation of the
incident microparticle flux in the near earth environment. The aim of the
multiple foil penetration and collection experiment is primarily to study
the feasibility of multilayer thin film detectors acting as energy sorters
in order to collect micrometeoroids, if not in their original shape, at
least as 'breakup' fragments suitable for chemical analysis. Foil
thicknesses range from 0.75 to 5 microns of Al.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) discovered three bands of
dust: one above, below, and approximately in the plane of the
ecliptic. These bands are located in the asteroid belt and are
believed to arise from collisional activity. Debris from an asteroid
collision, over time, fills a torus having peaks in particle number
density near its inner and outer corners, corresponding to the locus
of perihelia and aphelia, respectively. As a consequence of this
geometry, such a swarm should produce two pairs of bands that
straddle the ecliptic - a perihelion band pair and an aphelion band
pair (which generally overlap along the line of sight from earth).
Indeed, processing of the IRAS data now resolves the band structure
into at least three such band pairs, with indications of several more
pairs distributed over a large range of ecliptic latitudes.  Some of
these bands appear to be associated with major Hirayama asteroid
families, while others are not.  Possible origins of the observed
dust bands include: (1) the gradual comminution of the asteroid belts
as a whole, in which the local dust population is maximum where the
concentration of asteroids is greatest (e.g., families); (2) one or a
few large random asteroid collisions enhancing the local population
of small debris, which in turn is comminuted into dust; and (3) the
disintegration of one or more large comets.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
IRAS and near-IR coronographic data for the A5V star Beta Pic are
analyzed for evidence of planetary formation. The light scattered from
the central star in the system is integrated along the distance to the
star to determine the disk magnitude at various distances from the star.
A modified gamma distribution is applied to evaluate the scattering
coefficient to test a hypothesis that the inner 30 AU of the disk has
been swept out by planets. The scattering from the region around Beta
Pic is compared with scattering around other A5V stars. Finally, the IR
data at 0.89 micron is compared with scattering at the coronograph
wavelengths. No evidence is found to support the hypothesis of clearing
in the inner disk, although large particle densities can be found very
close to Beta Pic. The study illustrates the effectiveness of using
scattered light and IR data to discover and characterize matter
distributions circumstellar disks. },

   observational astronomy related to the sun and its immediate
   neighborhood. In particular, Brecher et al. concluded that such a ring,
   located at approximately four solar radii, must consist of refractory
   particles (graphite, for example) of size greater than 10 km at
   approximately 1,000-2,000 K which, therefore, would emit thermal
   radiation peaking around 1.5-3.0 microns. An attempt to detect the
   existence of this ring structure utilizing the IR observations taken
   during optimal viewing conditions of the total solar eclipse of February
   16, 1980, is reported.},

    ABSTRACT  = {
One method to detect extrasolar planetary systems is to deduce the
perturbations of planets on the observed circumstellar dust disks. Our solar
system, with its known configuration of planets, provides an excellent
example to study how the distribution of dust in the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt
(EKB) dust disk is affected by the existence of multiple and different
planets. Numerical simulations of the orbital evolution of dust particles
from EKB objects show that Neptune, by trapping dust particles in mean
motion resonances, creates a ringlike structure along its orbit. Jupiter and
Saturn, by ejecting dust particles from the solar system, create a radial
brightness profile inside 10 AU that is quite different from that of a dust
disk without their perturbations. On the other hand, Uranus and the
terrestrial planets do not produce significant signatures on the EKB dust

  ABSTRACT      = {
Significant magnetic field perturbations in the solar wind were
observed during the Phobos-2 elliptical orbits around Mars when the
spacecraft crossed the Phobos orbit. As remarkable feature, these
so-called Phobos events were detected in all cases only on the
upstream side of the Phobos orbit. A simple 1D fluid model is
developed which shows that a thin charged dust cloud with an
extension of no more than 100 km is able to produce phase-standing,
right-hand polarized precursor waves with a spatial periodicity of
about the proton skin length. This is the same type of upstream waves
which is generated by oblique, subcritical shocks. The measured
period of the magnetic variations may be explained as Doppler shift
owing to the spacecraft motion through the standing wave structure.
The fluid results are confirmed by hybrid code simulations. In
conclusion, we suggest the Phobos events to be precursor waves
resulting from the interaction of the solar wind with charged dust
rings along the Phobos orbit.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
As more and more meteorites from the Moon and Mars are discovered, it is
increasingly clear that impact fragments can escape from large bodies
more easily than previously believed.  For the case of the lunar
meteorites Warren has concluded that few, if any, common source craters
are plausible; thus at least a half-dozen separate lunar launch events
must have occurred in the last million years. Since the terrestrial
inventory of lunar meteorites is undoubtedly incomplete, one can argue
for a reasonably large injected flux of lunar material into the
near-Earth environs.  We study the transfer dynamics by means of
numerical simulations. We attempt to construct a self-consistent model
of lunar meteorite delivery that takes into account the impactor flux,
the delivery efficiency, and the statistics of meteorite finds.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Attention is given to the effects of the inner planets' perturbations
on the dynamics of small particles that produce the zodiacal light
through the scattering of sunlight; other forces acting on the
particles include radiation forces and the interaction with the solar
wind. The dynamical evolution of dust in interplanetary space is
investigated in view of the combined effects of these perturbations,
as well as the gravitational perturbations of Venus, Mars, the earth,
and Jupiter, yielding sample trajectories illustrating such common
occurrences as nonmonotonic changes in the semimajor axis,
eccentricity, and inclination of nodes. These are demonstrated to be
due to the inner planets rather than to Jupiter or nongravitational
forces.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The jovian ring system was observed during four orbits of Galileo's nominal
mission, when 25 clear-filter images of the rings were taken at spatial
resolutions of 23 to 134 kmsolarpixel&semi; the ring appeared fortuitously
in an additional 11 images. The tenuous jovian ring system (normal optical
depths<10^-5) has three components: the halo, main ring, and gossamer ring.

The innermost component, a toroidal halo, extends radially from
approximately 92,000 to about 122,500 km (near the 3 : 2 Lorentz resonance)
and has a full-width, half-maximum thickness of 12,500 km&semi; its
brightness decreases with height off the equatorial plane and decreases as
the planet is approached. The main ring reaches from the halo's outer
boundary across 6440 to 128,940 km, just interior to Adrastea's orbit
(128,980 km)&semi; at its outer edge, the main ring takes nearly 1000 km to
develop its full brightness. The ring's brightness noticeably decreases
around 127,850 km in the vicinity of Metis' semimajor axis (127,980 km). The
precise location and nature of the main ring's outer periphery may shift
slightly from image to image&semi; the same is true for the ``notch'' near
Metis. The main ring has a faint, vertically extended component that
thickens as the halo region is approached. Brightness variations of +/-10%
are visible in the central main ring and may be due to vertical
corrugations, density clumps, or ``spokes'' in the ring. Unexplained
differences between the near- and far-arm brightnesses are visible. We have
discovered that the gossamer ring, lying exterior to the main ring, has two
primary components, each of which is fairly uniform: one originates just
interior to Amalthea's orbit (181,366 km) while the other is situated
radially interior to Thebe's orbit (221,888 km). Very faint material
continues past Thebe, blending into the background at 250,000 km. The
gossamer rings have thicknesses that are comparable to the maximum
elevations of these satellites off Jupiter's equatorial plane; from
Galileo's nearly equatorial view, the gossamer rings present rectangular
end-profiles with greater intensities along their top and bottom surfaces.
The rings seem to be derived from the satellites.},

Tidal evolution of both Martian satellites is examined in relation to
a frequency dependent model of the tidal lag. Dissipation within the
planet and the satellite is taken into account simultaneously. The
orbit of Phobos is considered in the Laplacian plane of the system
because of solar perturbation. Dissipation within Phobos is found to
be a critical parameter to discriminate between different evolution
scenarios. For weak dissipation the inclination to the equator of
Mars has not changed much in the 4.5 billion years, with Phobos
orbiting Mars at 7 to 10 planetary radii at its origin, and with 0.6
eccentricity.},

Primary goals of the MUSES-A HITEN mission are to verify technologies and
techniques required for lunar and planetary missions in the near future.
One of the objectives was an experiment related with the detection and the
measurement of mass, velocity and crude flight direction of micrometeroid
particles with a Miniaturized Dust Detector (MDC). The experiment set up,
the measuring principle and the results of two year operation are
discussed; preliminary results show the cosmic dust flux versus time,
particle velocity and mass; the spatial and directional distributions are
presented as well as the orbital flight velocities of the particles. Space
debris measurements are planned with the MDC on board of the
microsatellite BREM-SAT. The two main objectives of this future mission
are outlined.}

  ABSTRACT      = {
Consideration is given to the possible indirect effects on the earth of a
10 to the 50th erg gamma ray flash from a supernova explosion at a
distance of 30 light years or less. It is shown that, in contrast to the
atmosphere-shielded earth surface, the lunar surface will absorb directly
the approximately 10 to the 10th erg/sq cm of gamma rays incident on it,
and become vaporized to a depth of 1 cm if the energy is deposited in less
than a second or be ejected by a pressure pulse. Part of the vapor could
then reach lunar escape velocity and be captured by the earth's
gravitational field, filtering down through the atmosphere to the surface
within several decades. Evidence of lunar surface vaporization or mass
ejection resulting in mass transfer to the earth could consist of
melted-recrystallized areas on the lunar surface, or of an overabundance
of iriduim in terrestrial geological strata. Additional possible effects
of a strong gamma-ray flash include ozone suppression in the atmosphere,
leading to increased surface solar UV radiation, and climatic effects due
to the presence of lunar particles, possibly leading to severe biological
effects.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
We show that even if the interplanetary dust
of sub-micron size is originally neutral, it would become highly ionized
by solar ultraviolet radiation. Assuming interplanetary dust to be
drifting in as neutral particles at 10km/s, we derive the probable charge
that they may pick up during their motion in the solar system. Using this
value for the charge, we analyze the particle arrival pattern of the
interplanetary dust in low earth orbits due to modulation by the
geomagnetic field. Using an accurate model of the geomagnetic field from
the International Geophysical Reference Field (IGRF), we show that the
interplanetary dust would arrive at high latitudes only. We then
show that since man-made debris is released at very low altitude, it
would arrive isotropically even if it is heavily charged. Hence even from
a low earth orbit satellite, it may be possible to distinguish man-made
debris from the interplanetary dust.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Attempts to synthesize optical and infrared results in modeling the
zodiacal dust cloud are considered.  Several analytical presentations
of the three-dimensional distribution of interplanetary dust have
been derived from measurements of the zodiacal light. To provide a
basis for comparisons with infrared measurements classical and some
new optical approaches are reviewed and compared with observations of
the zodiacal light all over the sky and in selected viewing
directions. Strengths and weaknesses of the models are discussed and
qualitatively explained.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Ballistic transport, defined as the net radial transport of mass and
angular momentum due to exchanges of meteoroid hypersonic-impact
ejecta by neighboring planetary ring regions on time-scales
orders-of-magnitude shorter than the age of the solar system, is
presently considered as a problem in mathematical physics. The
preliminary results of a numerical scheme for following the combined
effects of ballistic transport and viscous diffusion demonstrate that
ballistic transport generates structure near sharp edges already
present in the ring-mass distribution; the entire ring system
ultimately develops an undulatory structure whose length scale is
typically of the order of the radial excursion of the impact ejecta.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Microcrater frequencies caused by fast (at least 3 km/sec) ejecta have
been determined using secondary targets in impact experiments. The angular
distribution of the secondary-crater number densities shows a primary
maximum around 25 deg and a secondary maximum at about 60 deg from the
primary target surface. The fraction of mass ejected at velocities of at
least 3 km/sec is only a factor of 0.000075 of the primary projectile
mass. A conservative calculation shows that the contribution of secondary
microcraters (caused by fast ejecta) to primary microcrater densities on
lunar rock surfaces (caused by interplanetary particles) is on the
statistical average below 1% for any lunar surface orientation.
Calculation of the interplanetary dust-flux enhancement caused by lunar
ejecta is found to be in good agreement with Lunar Explorer 35 in situ
measurements.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The present numerical simulations of the Uranian rings
discovered by Voyager 2 indicate that they may be the visible
component of low optical depth moonlet belts made up of 10 to
100,000 cm objects; these objects would serve as the sources of
dust, via both micrometeoroid bombardment and the collisional
release of ejecta. It is proposed that the dust bands are
generated by continuous ejection and reabsorption of
micron-scale regolith material within the hypothesized moolet
belts, and it is noted that numerical simulations of such a
system in a Markov-chain formalism can reproduce Uranian dust
ring characteristics.},

The results of Voyager experiments to characterize the eccentric
ringlet at 1.45 Saturn radius are discussed.  The Voyager I carried
out microwave occultation trials with a dual-frequency transmitter,
while Voyager 2 observed the occultation of delta Scorpii using an UV
spectrometer and a photopolarimeter. The ringlet was associated with
a basically empty region next to an edge of the C ring which
decreased to a few hundred meters thickness. The width of the ringlet
in the gap was estimated to vary from 38-88 km, and it maintains an
elliptical shape. It precesses within the 265 km gap it occupies, and
has a double-peaked core 15 km wide.  The bulk of the ringlet is
particles of less than 1 cm radius.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
A numerical simulation has been performed to calculate the
distributions of dust particles of various sizes down the tail of
comet P/Giacobini-Zinner. When the electrostatic charging of the
grains in the plasma and radiative environment of the comet is taken
into account, it is found that the distribution of the grains
(particularly at the lowest end of the mass spectrum) in a plane
normal to the orbital plane is entirely different from what is
expected had the grains been uncharged. Although the NASA-ICE
spacecraft, which will fly through the tail of this comet almost
normal to its orbital plane on September 11, 1985, has no dedicated
dust experiments, it is expected that the plasma wave instrument will
serve as an indirect detector, even of the smallest grains, via the
plasma clouds created by the high-velocity dust impacts. Knowledge of
the spatial variation of the grain sizes encountered along the flight
path of the spacecraft will provide us with the information necessary
to calculate the electrostatic potential of the grains, which in turn
will lead to an estimation of the role of the electromagnetic forces
on the dynamics of such grains.},

The plasma and magnetic-field effects in the neighborhood of orbits

The data give the examples of a rather strong interaction with some
shock-like signatures. Observations from the Phobos 2 spacecraft
suggest that gas/dust tori/rings reside along the Mars moon orbits.
The tori are partially immersed in the subsonic Martian tailward
flowing plasma. Thus it may strongly disturb the dynamics of the
magnetospheric plasma.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Adiabatic equations of motion are derived for the micrometer-sized dust
grains detected in the Jovian and Saturn magnetospheres by the Pioneer 10
and 11 spacecraft. The adiabatic theory of charged particle motion is
extended to the case of variable grain charge. Attention is focused on the
innermost and outermost limits to the grain orbit evolution, with all
orbits tending to become circular with time. The parameters such as the
center equation of motion, the drift velocity, and the parallel equation
of motion are obtained for grains in a rotating magnetosphere.
Consideration is given to the effects of periodic grain charge-discharge,
which are affected by the ambient plasma properties and the grain plasma
velocity. The charge-discharge process at the gyrofrequency is determined
to eliminate the invariance of the magnetic moment and cause the grain to
exhibit radial movement. The magnetic moment increases or decreases as a
function of the gyrophase of the charge variation.}

well as two particle potential. The radiation pressure force is treated
independently under a geometric, Raleigh, and the full Mie scattering
theory approximation. Comparisons of the beta values under all of the
above are calculated and analyzed. A computer model which calculates and
categories orbits for particles originating on the lunar surface and
traveling in selenocentric, cislunar, and geocentric space is presented.
The results using the data from over 1.9 million individual orbits
calculated under varying initial conditions for the earth, moon, and
particle are given. The radiation pressure force term in the above
mentioned computer model is again calcualted under all the approximations
listed previously. A correlation between the particle's complex index of
refraction and its probability of intersection with the EMPs is shown.
Evidence is presented to show that particles with radii below 0.1 microns
can indeed attain a near-earth orbit under the proper conditions.  A
method whereby the origin of particles in the near-earth orbit can be
determined is discussed.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
 A grid of models of the particulate disk around Beta Pic is constructed
in which the same grains orbiting the star give rise to both the
directly observable scattered starlight and the FIR thermal radiation
measured by IRAS. The spatial distribution of particles in the disk is
determined to find a distribution from coronograph images (Paresce and
Burrows, 1987) and used with IRAS measurements to find a distribution of
matter in both the directly observable and occulted disk regions. An
upper limit for the tilt between the disk ecliptic and the line of sight
is determined to be 14 deg, corresponding to an infinitesimally thin
disk. Also, the normal optical thickness of the disk, the grain radii,
and the model-dependent geometric albedo of grains in the visible are
determined. Possible grain composition is also considered.},

The Voyager Photopolarimeter Experiment detected the Neptunian
rings 1989N1R and possibly 1989N2R. These rings were also
photographed by the Voyager imaging cameras in August 1989. The
firm detection of 1989N1R has an equivalent depth (the product
of the radial width and mean normal optical depth) of 0.77 + or
- 0.13 km, while a less certain detection of 1989N2R has an
equivalent depth of 0.7 km + or - 0.2 km.  Several statistical
techniques were used to search for additional material in the
Neptune ring system, and none was identified at a high
confidence level.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
New reflectance spectra at 3.5 percent resolution have been obtained for
Ariel, Titania, Oberon, and Hyperion in the 0.8 to 1.6-micron spectrum
region. The new spectra show no absorptions other than the 1.5 micron
water-ice feature (within the precision of the data), and demonstrate
extension into the 0.8- to 1.6 micron region of the 1.5- to 2.5 micron
spectral similarity ofo Ariel to Hyperion (Brown and Cruikshank, 1983).
The new data confirm the presence of a dark, spectrally bland component
on/in the water-ice surfaces of the Uranian satellites, which, with some
reservations, has spectral similarities to the dark substance on the
leading side of lapetus and the dark material on/in the surface of
Hyperion, as well as other dark, spectrally neutral substances such as
charcoal. Attempts were made to match the spectra of Ariel, Titania, and
Oberon with additive reflectance mixes (aeral coverage) of fine-grained
water frost and various dark components such as charcoal, lampblack, and
charcoal-water-ice mixtures. The results were broad limits on the
amounts of possible areal coverage of a charcoal-like spectral component
on the surfaces of the Uranian satellites, but the data are not of
sufficient precision to conclusively determine whether the dominant mode
of contaminant dispersal is areal or voluminal. The effect of highly
variegated albedos on the diameters derived by Brown, Cruikshank, and
Morrison (1982) is found to be small.},

The brightness structure within Cassini's division in Saturn's rings
is explained in terms of perturbations produced by moonlets embedded
within an optically thin disk of smaller ring particles. The moonlets
exert gravitational torques on neighboring ring particles and create
gaps; diffusion acts to fill the gaps. A new explanation is offered
for the inner edge of the Cassini division being located at the 2:1
resonance with Mimas.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
There has been some controversy on the density distribution n(r) at
distance r from the star in the Beta Pic dust disk: n proportional to
1/r cubed (derived on the assumption that particles are isotropically
reflecting) versus n proportional to 1/r (inferred from the inversion
equation for the scattering function), supposing in both cases that the
dust size distribution is the same everywhere. Here, the inversion
equation for the observed surface brightness distribution is studied. It
is found that the distribution of the scattering cross section per unit
volume must be proportional to r exp (1-mu) unless the dust is much more
steeply forward-scattering than the interplanetary dust responsible for
the zodiacal light. },

A program simulating the random effects of both gravitational
scattering and accretion in a system of earth-scaled objects is
presently applied to the cases of macroaccretion in Uranus and
Neptune. The numerical results thus obtained are useful in
approximating the few-times-100-million-year time-scales of
stochastic collisions, and thereby the large tilting of the
protoplanets. It appears probable that the insertion of a small
number of terrestrial-scale objects in the trans-Neptunian region
acts as the driver of inward orbital diffusion for a cometary belt
that is located outside Neptune's orbit; a few large planetesimals
may have scattered into orbits crossing the asteroid belt,
gravitationally stirring the orbits of the main-belt asteroids.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The possibility of removing particles from Io by interactions with the
Jovian magnetosphere has been investigated. It is found that dust grains
of about 0.1 micron radius will rapidly become charged if exposed to the
ambient Jovian plasma. For particles this size in Io's volcanic plumes,
the Lorentz force can overcome Io's gravity and these particles can
escape. Escaping dust will be controlled by the topology of the
magnetosphere and it is suggested that Io-derived dust may be an
important source of erosive impacts on large Jovian ring particles and
destructive collisions with small particles. The ring particles
themselves will interact with the Jovian plasma and it is suggested that
Coulomb scattering of plasma particles by charged dust grains may
produce a plasma gap or void in the vicinity of the rings.},

The restricted three-body problem is generalized with the inclusion
of solar radiation pressure. For small particles (typically 1 micron
to 1 mm) the familiar equilibrium triangular points L sub 4 and L sub
5 no longer exist. However, libration orbits are not completely
destroyed, although an effect of resonance caused their amplitude to
be very large, for a particle initially at rest at either of the
triangular point. Finally, the results of a study of the linearized
equations of motion, supplemented by a numerical integration, ruled
out the possibility of an accumulation of dust at the earth-moon
Lagrangian triangular points.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Meteoroid fluxes in interplanetary space at 5 AU and near Jupiter
have been measured with the penetration detectors on Pioneer 10 and
Pioneer 11. The data suggest that the size distribution of meteoroids
at 5 AU is the same as that at 1 AU. Furthermore, the high flux
observed near Jupiter appears due to meteoroids in orbit about the
sun being gravitationally focused toward the planet. There is no
indication of a large population of particles in orbit around
Jupiter. Calculations show that the mass influx of meteoroids on
Jupiter is 170 times that on the earth, but this does not have a
significant effect on the energy balance of Jupiter. The high speed
with which meteoroids enter the Jovian atmosphere causes them to be
brighter than those on earth so that the number of visible meteors is
5800 times the number in the earth's atmosphere.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
   The lifetimes of meteoroids against catastrophic collisions with
   zodiacal dust particles is evaluated for specific orbits, including, for
   the first time, the effect of the orbital inclination. A simple fan
   model of the form r exp -1.3 (1-sin beta) is used for the zodiacal
   cloud, where r is the solar distance and beta the ecliptic latitude.
   Although the results are for meteoroids of radius 1 mm, the collisional
   lifetimes for larger or smaller bodies can be found by the application
   of simple scaling factors. The figures can be used to estimate the
   collisional lifetime of any meteoroid in any particular orbit. The
   collisional lifetimes of 28 well known streams are also calculated.
   Finally, an alternative method for the calculation of the spatial
   density of an object in an arbitrary orbit is presented.},

Using a simple model of the particles and fields environment of a
comet, the trajectories of the smallest (micron- and submicron-sized)
dust grains that are expected to be released from a cometary nucleus
are calculated. It is shown that electromagnetic forces play a
crucial role in the dynamics of these particles. The present
calculations indicate not only the asymmetry of the sunward dust
envelopes that have been suggested earlier by other authors, but they
also indicate the possible existence of wavy dust features far down
the tail, reminiscent of the peculiar wavy dust feature observed in
the dust tail of Comet Ikeya-Seki 1965f. The importance of these
findings in studying the lower end of the cometary dust mass spectrum
during the forthcoming fly-by missions to Comet Halley is
underscored.},

The discovery of a microsignatury of trapped radiation in the
Amalthea orbit as detected by Pioneer 11 in a flyby of Juptier in
1974 is reported and its implications for the radial diffusion
coefficient in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere are discussed. A low
energy telescope registered the absorption of low-energy protons as a
function of the magnetic L shell durig inbound and outbound
trajectories. Drift velocities of the 1 MeV particles were
calculated. No correspondingly heightened effects were observed from
high-energy electrons or heavier nuclei. Further analysis of the
0.5-8.7 MeV protons showed data to be consistent erosion of the
particle drift shadows by a diffusion process. A limit was calculated
for the highest diffusion coefficient value for the 1 MeV protons at
the Amalthea orbit. The results indicate that the diffusion is driven
by fluctuating electric or magnetic fields.},

The fundamental properties of the horseshoe and tadpole orbit
solutions to the three-body problem where the mass of the third body

the satellite with which it is in resonance, as in the case of the
coorbital satellites of Saturn. Particle trajectories in the
solutions to the restricted three-body problem are found to be
closely related to the shape of the associated zero-velocity curves.
Particles close to the satellite orbit are shown to move in
near-periodic orbits with orbital changes produced in one satellite
encountered effectively cancelled by the next. An approximate
expression is derived for the minimum angular separation between the
satellite and the particle, and dependences of particle lifetimes and
the relative widths of horseshoe and tadpole regions on the mass
ratio are found. These relations are applied to the coorbital
satellites of Saturn, 1980S1 and 1980S3, which are shown to be
librating in horseshoe orbits, and it is noted that the satellite
masses may thereby be determined. Consideration is also given to the
horseshoe and tadpole orbital dynamics of the coorbital satellites of
Dione and Tethys.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Flux measurements of picogram dust particles near the lunar surface
and in selenocentric and cis-lunar space made by Lunar Explorer 35,
HEOS, and ALSOP dust experiments all indicate, to varying degrees,
ejecta from lunar impacts of interplanetary dust particles. The
orbits of these submicron particles in the earth-moon system are
significantly altered by radiation pressure. Recent orbit
calculations show that, in favorable lunar phases, as many as 80% of
the ejecta may enter the magnetosphere and 20% may enter the earth's
atmosphere. The results of this analysis are presented, and their
implications are discussed.},

An analysis is presented of the charging processes for the dust
particles in the circumsolar dust band at 4 solar radii, as well as the
effects of the interactions between these charged particles and the
magnetized ambient solar wind plasma on the evolution of their orbits.
It is concluded that due to the higher values of the potential on the
dust particle and the ambient solar wind magnetic field, the Lorentz
force affects a much wider size range of particles in the near-solar
regions. Since the magnitude of the Lorentz force is much higher and its
characteristic time to affect the particle's orbit is much lower than
those for the Poynting-Robertson drag force, the Lorentz force is a
major perturbing force for dust particles in the circumsolar dust band
at 4 solar radii.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The production rate of dust associated with the prominent Hirayama
asteroid families and the background asteroidal population are
modeled with the intent of using the families as a calibrator of
mainbelt dust production. However, the dust production rates of
asteroid families may be highly stochastic; there is probably more
than an order of magnitude variation in the total area of dust
associated with a family. Over 4.5 x 10(exp 9) years of collisional
evolution, the volume (mass) of a family is ground down by an order
of magnitude, suggesting a similar loss from the entire mainbelt
population. Our collisional models show that the number of meteoroids
deliverable to Earth also varies stochastically, but only by a factor
of 2 to 3.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Because of the motion of the sun through the surrounding interstellar
medium, interstellar dust particles may penetrate deep into the solar
system. In this paper, the conditions for this penetration are
investigated, and it is found that the distribution of such particles
should peak along the line of gravitational focusing. Two possible
consequences are compared with experimental results: the rate at which
particles should strike a micrometeoroid detector and the distribution of
scattered solar light. The number density of particles penetrating the
solar system, derived from this comparison, is found to be much smaller
than predicted by a crude model of interstellar matter.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The scattering of dust grain orbits due to recurrent sectors of the
interplanetary magnetic field is reinvestigated with a better formalism.
The method used reveals the resonant character of the diffusion, and is
well suited for the problem. The spreads in the orbital parameters are
found to be less important than believed until now and to vary rapidly
with eccentricity and semimajor axis. Only the small dielectric grains
with size less than 0.5 microns may be scattered by the Lorentz force
fluctuations; the main diffusion occurs in inclination and near the sun
(20-60 solar radii).},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Since the discovery of the first trans-Neptune object and the still
ongoing discoveries of such objects, it has been proposed that
micron-sized dust particles produced from those so-called "Kuiper belt
objects" may contribute significantly to the interplanetary dust
population that constitutes the zodiacal cloud. We report here
preliminary results from numerical calculations of the orbital evolution
of such dust particles. Due to Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag and solar
wind drag, micron-sized dust particles will spiral toward the Sun once
they are released from their large parent bodies. This motion leads dust
particles to pass by planets as well as encounter numerous mean motions
resonances (MMRs) associated with planets. Trapping into exterior MMRs
with Neptune and, to a lesser extent, Uranus dominates the orbital
evolution of those particles. Gravitational scattering by Saturn or
Jupiter usually controls their final fate. Sixteen out of twenty
particles in our numerical modeling eventually were scattered out of the
Solar System. The remaining four particles were able to complete their
journeys all the way to the Sun.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
This paper will list, investigate, and evaluate the various spin
mechanisms for cosmic dust particles that have been suggested in the
literature. This evaluation will concentrate on the possibility of
particle fragmentation (rotational bursting) of cosmic dust. The
importance of partical fragmentation is manifested by the fact that dust
particle size distribution will be changed. More importantly, repeated
fragmentation of interplanetary dust particles will give rise to some of
the observed 'beta meteoroids.' Some of these particles are driven out
of the solar system and into interstellar space by solar radiation
pressure. If this mass loss mechanism is taking place in stellar
systems, then it becomes a source for interstellar dust. This paper also
addresses the possibility that massive rotational bursting by
circumsolar dust particles is taking place in the F corona region. This
rotational bursting of F coronal dust could be taking place because of
the classical 'Paddack effect,' along with a similar spin mechanism
suggested by the author, and caused by coronal mass ejections.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Voyager and Galileo images have shown that Jupiter's ring consists of
several components: 1) a 10,000 km wide main ring associated with the
satellites Metis and Adrastea, 2) a vertically-extended halo located inward
of the main ring, and 3) Gossamer rings associated with the small satellites
Thebe and Amalthea. The gross properties of the rings are probably due to
electromagnetic forces, which cause resonances at specific locations, and
Poynting-Robertson drag, which makes orbits evolve inward. First-order
electromagnetic, or Lorentz, resonances seem to bound the inner and outer
edges of the jovian ring halo, while in the outer gossamer ring, these
vertical Lorentz resonances are strong enough to trap dust grains smaller
than a few microns in radius and systematically drive them to high
inclinations.

Additionally, we have found two new and interesting sets of resonances near
synchronous orbit. Both sets are second-order resonances, where the small
quantities are orbital eccentricities and inclinations in one case and the
strength of the perturbation forces in the other. Both sets of resonances
have analogs in gravitational systems. These resonances affect the orbital
properties of ring particles near synchronous orbit, and may lead to
observable features in the structure of the ring. Indeed, Voyager noted an
enhancement in density near synchronous orbit, although Galileo observations
do not confirm this observation.

Finally, we have implemented a symplectic integrator capable of handing an
array of perturbations affecting dust: planetary, solar, and satellite
gravity, radiation pressure, and the velocity-dependent Lorentz force. We
are currently running tests to determine circumstances under which the new
integrator is superior to more commonly used Runge-Kutta and Bulirish Stoer
algorithms and will report our initial findings.},

The dynamics of submicron-sized dielectric particles lost from the
Martian moon Phobos are studied in connection with the possible
detection of dust by the Phobos 2 spacecraft. The motion of these
small dust grains is influenced not only by gravity but also by solar
radiation pressure and electromagnetic forces. The plasma environment
of Mars is described by applying a hybrid gasdynamic-cometary model.
Some of the submicron-sized grains ejected at speeds on the order of
a few tens meters per second can stay in orbit around Mars for
several months forming a nonuniform and time-dependent dust halo.},

and runaway growth are essential and robust. By the way, "orderly" growth means that
most of the mass of the system is in large embryos instead of the smaller planetesimals.
I.e. the ratio  v_esc/v_thermal  is of the order of 1 and almost constant, because
v_thermal is produced by gravitational scattering of the largest bodies to be in
the order of v_esc. Dynamical friction damps the random walk of the biggest bodies and
stirrs the smaller ones. The latter are more prevented to grow "orderly" which means
most of the mass remains in smaller particles. The stirring is counteracted by
more efficient dampings for small bodies: gas-drag, enhanced collision rate due to

  ABSTRACT      = {
It is proposed that Saturn's electrostatic discharges (SED) might be
generated in the planet's equatorial atmosphere, perhaps as lightning
from a storm system. The 10-h-10-min periodicity of the signal
envelope duplicates that of Saturn's equatorial jet. The rings shield
the atmosphere from solar EUV photons, and thereby substantially
reduce the local ionospheric cutoff frequency to allow low-frequency
SED to leak out. Many of the unusual properties of SED could be
explained in terms of changes in the storm system, the relative
spacecraft position in the beaming pattern of the source, local
refraction of the signal by the highly disturbed ionosphere, and the
influence of the ring particles on the highest frequency component of
SED. A comparison of SED with planetary lightning on other planets
shows that the two are similar in general character and some time
behavior; the power output of SED may be higher than most planetary
lightning, but that is unclear because of uncertainties in the
measurements and variations in the signal's spectrum. It is suggested
that lightning could be a viable source for SED and that exotic ring
mechanisms are not necessarily required.},

The main characteristics of the evolution of Hyperion's orbit are
obtained within the framework of the external variant of the circular
restricted three-body problem with due account for Saturn's oblateness.
The derivation of equations for Hyperion's orbit is described. An
analytical solution for the Titan-Hyperion system, which can be used as
an intermediate orbit, is proposed. The elements of Hyperion's orbit are
examined, and the phase plane of the satellite is represented.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The analysis of interplanetary dust shows that the majority of particles
in out-of-ecliptic regions come from comets and also that near solar
dust, in the ecliptic regions, results are most probably largely from
comets. The intense radiation flux in the solar vicinity is expected to
cause strong modifications in the material composition and surface
structure of interplanetary dust particles and hence the analysis of
near solar dust provides interesting insights into the evolution of
meteoritic, especially cometary materials. Because of the lack of
in-situ measurements our present knowledge concerning these processes
derives from remote sensing, i.e. observations of the solar F-corona. In
particular these are observations of albedo, polarization and color
temperature given in terms of average particle properties. For example
the analysis of near infra-red F-corona data points to the existence of
a strong component of irregularly structured sillicate particles, most
probably of cometary origin. The data may indicate a subsequent
sublimation of different particles or different constituents of the
particles. Here we compare particle properties derived from F-corona
observations with model calculations of single particle properties and
discuss perspectives of future analysis of cometary dust in the
interplanetary cloud.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
A flow of {mu}m-sized interstellar grains has been identified with the
Ulysses dust detector in the outer solar system at about 5 AU from the
Sun. The observed flux is 1.5x10^-4^m^-2^/s of particles of mean mass
3x10^-13^g, which corresponds to a mass flux of 5x10^-17^g/m^2^/s. The
particles on hyperbolic trajectories have radiants which are compatible
with the flow of interstellar gas, although some velocity dispersion
occurs. The grains are on average a factor 30 more massive than the
classical interstellar grains which cause stellar extinction. However,
these smaller grains have not been detected by Ulysses. It is demonstrated
that radiation pressure and interaction of the charged grains with the
interplanetary magnetic field prevent these small grains from penetrating
down to the distance of Ulysses. The spatial density of interstellar
grains is compatible with zodiacal light observations. Some consequences
arising from the existence of big grains in the interstellar medium are
discussed.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Preliminary results from Pioneer 11 concerning the acceleration and
trapping of charged particles in the magnetic field of Saturn are
reported. The identification and measurement of the intensities and
spectra of charged particle species was performed by an experiment
including four charged particle sensor systems, within 20 Saturn
radii of the planet. Increases in the intensity of 0.5- to 1.8-MeV
protons within 15 Saturn radii indicate the trapping and acceleration
of particles in the dipole field region, while a decrease in proton
intensity between seven and four Saturn radii is attributed to
absorption by Dione and Enceladus and possibly ring material as well.
Proton and electron intensity distributions are found to be axially
symmetric within four Saturn radii, indicating a centered dipole
aligned with the planetary rotation axis. Trapped radiation
absorption at the orbit of Mimas is analyzed to obtain an upper limit
of 4 x 10 to the -8th Saturn radii-squared/sec to the inward
diffusion coefficient; an absorption-like feature observed at L = 2.5
is attributed to a previously unidentified satellite of diameter less
than 200 km and semimajor axis 2.51 Saturn radii. Radiation
absorption by the newly discovered F ring was also observed, however
beneath the A, B and C rings a low flux of high-energy electrons was
detected.},

An improved model of the Saturn magnetosphere and of the locations of
known moons and rings is invoked in the present reconsideration of Pioneer
11 observations of five abrupt depletions in the flux of trapped
magnetospheric electrons within a 2000-km-wide band around the F ring. It
is inferred that the observed depletions of charged particles are caused
by clumps of material with low optical depth; it is further hypothesized
that these clumps are composed of regolith ejecta, are generated by
collisions occurring within a belt of unseen, moonlet-scale (or smaller)
objects occupying the entire radial region between Pandora and Prometheus.
Attention is given to a self-consistent scenario in which these debris
clouds are created, longitudinally spread, swept up onto belt object
surfaces, and then thrown off by a subsequent collision.},

  ABSTRACT       = {
     We present new coronagraphic images of Beta Pictoris obtained with
     the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) in September 1997.
     The high-resolution images (0.1") clearly detect the circumstellar
     disk as close as 0.75" to the star, corresponding to a projected
     radius of 15 AU. The images define the warp in the disk with
     greater precision and at closer radii to Beta Pic than do previous
     observations. They show that the warp can be modelled by the
     projection of two components: the main disk, and a fainter
     component, which is inclined to the main component by 4-5 degrees,
     and which extends only as far as about 4" from the star. We interpret
     the main component as arising primarily in the outer disk and the
     tilted component as defining the inner region of the disk.
     The observed properties of the warped inner disk are inconsistent
     with a driving force from stellar radiation. However, warping
     induced by the gravitational potential of one or more planets is
     consistent with the data. Using models of planet-warped disks
     constructed by Larwood and Papaloizou (1997), we derive possible
     masses of the perturbing object.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The orbital evolution of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) from both
retrograde and prograde Halley-type comets is numerically simulated. It is
found that dust particles nearly always get trapped into one or more mean
motion resonances (MMRs) with giant planets while in retrograde orbits. Of
the 1000 retrograde particles simulated 116 are trapped in MMRs that last
longer than 100,000 years, and the MMRs are typically exterior MMRs of the
type p:1 with Jupiter where p ranges from 1 to 12. We present a simple
analysis of the physical processes involved when an IDP is in a resonance. A
quasistable resonance is maintained by the combined effect of the direct
perturbation from the planet as well as the indirect perturbation that
arises because the Sun is moving around the Sun-planet barycenter. The
direct and indirect perturbations are often of comparable magnitudes,
although one or the other can be dominant. Of the 1000 retrograde particles
simulated, 45 of them evolved to prograde orbits while in MMRs with a giant
planet. Although the overall distribution in eccentricity and inclination of
10-7 g dust particles from Halley-type comets is consistent with D. H.
Humes' (1980, J. Geophys. Res. 85, 5841-5852) interpretation of the Pioneer
10 and 11 data, the spatial density variation is not. Instead of the
constant spatial density derived by Humes, the spatial density of
Halley-type comet dust varies as r-&gamma; with heliocentric distance r,
where &gamma; ranges from 1.5 to 1.8. Additional sources of interplanetary
dust particles are needed to account for the discrepancy.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The partitioning of energy and the distribution of the resultant ejecta on
the moon is numerically modeled using a Eulerian finite difference grid.
The impact of an iron meteoroid at 15 km/sec on a gabbroic anorthosite
lunar crust is examined. The high speed impact induced flow is described
over the entire hydrodynamic regime from a time where the peak pressures
are 6 Mbar until the stresses everywhere in the flow are linearly elastic,
and less than 5 kbar. Shock-induced polymorphic phase changes,
(plagioclase and pyroxene to hollandite and perovskite), and the
subsequent reversion to low pressure phases are demonstrated to enhance
shock wave attenuation. A rate-dependent equation of state is used for
describing the hysteretic effect of the phase change. Ballistic equations
for a spherical planet are then applied to material with net velocity away
from the moon.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The experiment measures the mass, speed and approximate influx
direction of the micrometeoroids. The temporal distribution of the
particles indicates three different categories. Category 1 consists
of three large groups of particles (swarms), each of which
encountered the detector within some tens of minutes.  Category 2
includes eight small groups of particles, each of which was detected
within hours. Category 3 is made up by the remaining particles, which
are randomly distributed. The swarms are of very recent origin,
possibly supplied by (1) meteoroids grazing the earth's atmosphere,
(2) ejecta from the moon, and (3) collisions of dust particles. The
groups may be dissipated swarms or particles from the outer zone of
swarms. The randomly distributed particles consist of sporadic
interplanetary particles and completely dissipated groups. The
comparison of both the particle rates (number of detected particles
per day) and the cumulative particle flux curves for the earth's
apex, antiapex, and ecliptic north and south directions shows that
the rates vary only within a factor of 2, whereas the particle flux
is extremely anisotropic.},

The statistical theory of Keplerian orbits is used to determine initial
conditions that lead rapidly to radial focusing of a particle stream.
Computer simulations of radial focusing are performed for several initial
distributions of eccentricity and inclination. The results obtained for
nine different cases indicate that, depending on initial conditions, a
Keplerian particle stream can contract into a monolayer or form a stable
ring, a series of small stable rings, two apparently unstable rings, or a
sequence of ringlets and gaps.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The origin of the eccentricity gradient which gives rise to the
marked variation in the width of the epsilon ring of Uranus and of
the apse alignment of the eccentric epsilon ring is discussed. The
geometry of the epsilon ring is considered, and it is shown that the
observation that the width of the ring at any one point increases
linearly with the radial distance of the point from the center of the
planet places severe constraints on the apse alignment of the ring.
The horseshoe orbit model proposed by Dermott et al. (1979, 1980) and
the self-gravitation model of Goldreich and Tremaine (1979) intended
to account for the precise apse alignment and the variation in width
are examined, and deficiencies in these models are pointed out. A
theory of apse alignment resulting from precessional pinch and the
close packing of the particles at pericenter is proposed and used to
predict the structure of the newly discovered narrow F ring of
Saturn.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Studies using the stellar occultation technique to detect dark matter
around Uranus and Neptune are reported. Recent analyses of isolated
events observed around Neptune indicate the existence of an
incomplete or at least a highly azimuthally variable ring or 'arc'
around Neptune. Similar phenomena may be detectable around Uranus. In
order to look for yet undetected dark matter around Uranus and
Neptune, the best signal-to-noise ratio stellar occultations have
been reanalyzed. To be confirmed, an 'event' should be observed with
more than one telescope on the same site since the Fresnel scale is
about 2-3 km at the level of Uranus and Neptune, and it should also
be observed from widely separated observatories (100 to 1000 km
apart) to have an idea of the spatial extent of the occulting object,
and to distinguish between satellites and ring-like structures.
Moreover, theoretical models of diffracting bars or circular objects
provide useful tests to reject some isolated events as being
incompatible with real and celestial events. An investigation is
reported of the surroundings of Uranus and Neptune using stellar
occultations observed at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) on
Apr. 22, 1982, and at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) on
June 15, 1983.  The high signal-to-noise ratio of these observations
sets stringent limits on the presence of matter around these planets.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
An explanation for the vertical structure and thickness of Saturn's
rings compatible with observational data is presented. The model of
the rings as being many particles thick is shown to be possible, with
random particle motions preventing the complete flattening of the
system and a gaussian distribution of particle density with vertical
displacement. The model prediction of a maximum ring thickness of
tens of meters, however, is in conflict with observations of ring
thickness of at least 0.8 km at ring-plane passage. It is shown that
perturbations to ring particle orbits caused by the sun and Saturn's
large satellites may produce long- and short-period coherent vertical
ring displacements and a nonlinear displacement of the ring plane
from the equatorial plane with radial distance, leading to an
apparent edge-on thickness of a few hundred meters.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The beta  Pictoris disk is an especially dense and fortuitously edge-on
arrangement of solid material around a nearby A5 main sequence star, a
prime example of a new class of objects discovered by IRAS.  Three
similar systems (alpha  Lyrae = Vega, A0; alpha  Piscis Austrinus =
Fomalhaut, A3; and epsilon  Eridani, K2) have been resolved in the IR or
sub-mm.
The grain temperatures in the prototype systems are 50-150 K, implying
disk scales of a few x 100 AU.  Each has a central zone of relatively
low density with size similar to our solar system's planetary zone.
Lifetime arguments imply that the dust is not primordial but must be
replenished from larger bodies.  The dust in the resolved systems
appears to lie in disks in the stellar equatorial planes based on a
comparison between the shapes of the emitting regions and values of
stellar rotational v sin(i).
As many as 100 other nearby main sequence stars have far-IR excesses in
IRAS and ISO data.  Circumstellar dust appears to be common among main
sequence stars and may persist well beyond the protoplanetary stage.  At
the same time, some nearby systems with especially dense disks may be
very young stars with disks still clearing.
Spectra of the material close to beta  Pic and 51 Oph show 10 mu m
silicate emission mineralogically resembling the grains in comet comae.
Silicate and organic hydrocarbon emission has been observed from other
systems.
The best solar system analog in scale and morphology to the main
sequence disks is the Kuiper Belt.  Ground-based and HST observations
have revealed a population of planetesimals in the Kuiper Belt, allowing
the equilibrium dust population and evolutionary status of the
extrasolar systems to be compared with the KB.  The IR  emission from
the zodiacal and KB dust components of our solar system would be much
easier to detect externally than radiation from the planets themselves. },

  ABSTRACT      = {
The electromagnetic effects of the solar wind interaction with the
neutral gas halo and the dust ring around Phobos are examined in this
paper. The analysis is used to account for the strong correlation
which arose during the Phobos-2 mission between the local enhancement
of the electron density and magnetic fluctuations and the spacecraft
crossings with the Phobos orbit. The solar wind/neutral gas
interaction cannot account for the observed correlation, snce the
outgassing rate of Phobos is too low. For the solar wind/dust ring
interaction, however, it is shown that a local enhancement of the
electron density is expected in regions of the dust ring which are
dominated by positively charged dust grains. These electrons become
decoupled from the solar wind protons in the dust ring region, and
evidence of this decoupling can be seen from the high level of wave
activity which results at frequencies below 100 Hz.},

Dust in the plasma and radiative environment of a comet is

these dynamical effects are reviewed and the pertinent observations

In the present paper, long-period and secular variations of the
longitude of ascending node are derived for a particle orbiting an
oblate precessing planet subjected to perturbation by an exterior
satellite moving along a low-inclination orbit. It is shown that
precession of Saturn under the solar torque, which causes the Laplace
plane to be noninertial, is also effective in producing a forced
inclination. The height above the Laplace plane associated with this
variation is several meters for a particle located in the middle of
the ring.},

The mass influx of meteoritic material at Earth exhibits two distinct
peaks: one centered at 10-5 grams, corresponding to the continuous,
planet-wide flux of micrometeorites, and a second corresponding to
the rare impacts of objects larger than 1014 grams. Using the
measured flux of meteoritic material at Earth and estimates of the
Mars/Earth flux ration, it was calculated that the micrometeorites
add between 2,700 and 59,000 tons of meteoritic material to the
surface of Mars annually. This corresponds to the accretion of
between 1.8 and 40 cm of meteoritic material per billion years. On
the Moon this meteoritic component constitutes 1 to 2 percent of the
mare soils. Depending on the indigenous regolith production rate on
Mars, the meteoritic material on Mars may be present in sufficient
concentration to serve as a resource for the volatile and siderophile
elements common in chondritic meteorites but rare in basaltic crustal
material. Since a significant fraction of the micrometeorites less
than 1200 mm in diameter survive atmospheric entry on Mars without
melting, they carry into the regolith the solar wind ions, including
H, He, and noble gases, implanted during their space exposure.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
           Magnetic field data measured by the MAGMA
           instrument in the Martian magnetotail lobes are
           compared with the ram pressure of the upstream
           solar wind observed by the TAUS instrument in the
           circular orbits of the Phobos 2 spacecraft. High
           correlation was found between the magnetic field
           intensity in the Martian magnetotail lobes and the
           solar wind ram pressure. From this relationship the
           average flaring angle of the Martian magnetotail
           was determined as similar to 13 degrees, and the
           average magnetosonic Mach number was estimated as
           similar to 5. The observed relationship between the
           Martian magnetotail magnetic field intensity and
           the solar wind magnetic field reflects the
           correlation of the solar wind magnetic field to the
           ram pressure providing a value of similar to 7 for
           the average Alfvenic Mach number. The flaring angle
           obtained for the Martian magnetotail was found to
           be an intermediate value between the flaring angle
           of the magnetotail of the Earth and that of Venus
           at comparable distances.},

The paper investigates the dust particle population within

between 7 February 1972 and 2 August 1974 for a total of 431
particles recorded. It is shown that the random particles and the
group events are only slightly enhanced in comparison with the
interplanetary particle population at 1 AU. This enhancement can be
interpreted as being due to the gravitational field of the earth. The
particle bursts are interpreted as ejecta particles from meteorite
impacts on the surface of the moon (groups) and as fragmentation
products of fragile larger bodies in the 10-1,000,000 g mass range
within the earth's magnetosphere (auroral zones) at 10 earth radii

  ABSTRACT      = {
Observations of the outer solar corona on Java were carried out on June
11, l983 at a 30-km altitude using a B-15 balloon. At 5325, 5965, 7200,
and 8015 A, data on polarizations in a field of 5 x 5 deg centered
nearly on the sun were obtained. The contour maps of polarization are
the first of the two-dimensional polarization distribution covering a
wide area. An excess of polarization at the four wavelengths was found
in the ecliptic plane and at the location of a coronal streamer. High
polarization at the coronal streamer is caused mainly by coronal
electrons, but dust grains in the region out of the ecliptic plane
contribute a few percent to the high polarization degree in this
streamer. It is confirmed by additional data that there is a peak in the
polarization excess in the ecliptic between 4 and 5 solar radii, as
already reported by Isobe et al (1985). This excess is considered to be
due to an enhanced distribution of dust in a ring or a thick wide band
around the sun.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Recent spacecraft and ground-based observations have revealed the
presence of narrow rings encircling the planets Jupiter, Saturn and
Uranus. The Jovian ring is known to contain at least two small, dark,
satellites of diameter between 20 and 40 km in its outer edge. The
structure of the Saturnian F ring has been resolved by Voyager 1 and
appears to be determined by the action of two small neighboring
satellites which were also imaged by the spacecraft. All nine Uranian
rings are extremely narrow and some are appreciably eccentric. The
outer epsilon ring has very sharp edges and its radial width
increases from 20 km at pericentre to 100 km at apocentre. This
marked variation in width is also characteristic of the Uranian alpha
and beta rings and of a narrow ring in the Saturnian system. The
structure of the Uranian eta ring is complex and may be similar to
that of the Saturnian F ring. The resolution of the numerous, but
well defined dynamical problems posed by these narrow rings must
precede any discussion of the origin of rings. Two co-orbital
Saturnian satellites that appear to move in horseshoe orbits have
been discovered. The stability of these orbits and the origin of
these and other co-orbital satellites are discussed.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Limb-fitting methods applied to Voyager images of the satellites of
Saturn have shown that some of these satellites are well-represented
by triaxial ellipsoids. Furthermore, the observed ratios of the
differences of the principal axes of these satellites are consistent
with those values expected for synchronous satellites in hydrostatic
equilibrium. For satellites of known mass, measurement of the shape
leads to a determination of the satellite's moment of inertia and
internal structure. The moment of inertia of Mimas determined by
Dermott and Thomas (1988) shows clearly that Mimas is not
homogeneous. For satellites of unknown mass, but known mantle
composition, measurement of the shape can lead to a determination of
the satellite's mass and mean density. This method has been
successfully applied to Enceladus.}

  ABSTRACT      = {
The evolution of micrometer-sized circumstellar grains orbiting Beta
Pictoris is studied, taking into account the combined effects of first
order resonances due to a hypothetical planet and the dissipative effect
due to Poynting-Robertson drag. We first derive the averaged equations
of motion of the grain near a resonance, and we describe qualitatively
and quantitatively the capture into the resonance (mechanism of
entrance, time scales for capture, etc.) It appears that the probability
of capture cannot be derived analytically, because of the
nonadiabaticity of the motion at the entrance into the resonance, at
least for micrometer-sized particles and planet masses smaller than
about one saturnian mass. We show that the capture of a grain into a
resonance critically depends (i) on the orbital eccentricity and (ii) on
the value of the critical argument of resonance just at the entrance
into the resonance. Maps of capture/noncapture regions vs these two
parameters are derived numerically for the 1:2, 2:3, and 3:4 resonances.
They show the complexity of the capture regions, and indicate that
uranian or larger planets are able to trap most of the grains into the
1:2 resonance, while approximately 5 Earth masses are sufficient to trap
grains into the 3:4 resonance for any grain with initial eccentricities
smaller than a few percent. These results underline the dynamical
importance of small planetary objects embedded in circumstellar dust
disks. },

The evolutionary, physical, chemical and observational astronomical
constraints are discussed, that can be placed on a hypothetical ring
around the sun. Attention is given to Blaggs's form (1913) of the
Titius-Bode law of planetary distances, as well as to the perihelion
advance. The constraints on properties of the ring particles are
considered, by the requirement of survival against solar irradiation.
Lastly, the possible destruction of the ring by particle collisions is
examined.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The consequences which arise from the mutual collisions occurring
between interplanetary meteoroids, the Poynting-Robertson (PR) effect
and the radiation pressure ejection of small meteoroids are examined.
The size distribution and flux of micrometeoroids at 1 AU are derived
and the dependence of spatial density on distance from the sun is
established. The following conclusions are made: (1) the lifetimes of
meteoroids with masses approximately greater than 0.00001 g are
dominated by catastrophic collisions; (2) after bering crushed by
collisions, 70 to 85 percent of this mass will be in the form of
zodiacal light particles (with masses in the range of 10 to the -10th
g to 10 to the -5th g) which will in part be transported by the PR
effect towards the sun where they will evaporate; (3) the 15 to 30
percent of the collisional fragments which have masses approximately
less than 10 to the -10th g will, for the most part, be injected into
hyperbolic orbits by radiation pressure.},

    Abstract = {
The classical Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) star RR Tau is known as a highly
variable young star with an amplitude of variability of about 4mag in
the V pass-band. In this paper we present the results of coordinated
Crimea-Dodaira multi-band photo-polarimetric observations of this star
which cover fully the observed interval of its brightness changes.
Within the observed interval of its light variations the linear
polarization of RR Tau anti-correlates with its brightness changes. The
dependence of the linear polarization on the stellar magnitude agrees
well with the model according to which the main source of the intrinsic
polarization of RR Tau is scattered radiation by the circumstellar (CS)
disk-like dust envelope (probably the protoplanetary disk) seen edge-on
or under a small inclination to the line-of-sight, and that the
brightness variations are caused by variable obscuration of the star by
revolving circumstellar dust clouds. A comparison with previous
photo-polarimetric observations of this star shows that the Stokes
parameters of its polarized radiation are quite stable on a time scale
of about 7 years. By using this fact we have separated the interstellar
and intrinsic components of the observed polarization. The numerical
modeling of the intrinsic linear polarization together with the
colour-magnitude diagrams of RR Tau show that the circumstellar
disk-like envelope around this star is strongly flattened and that the
characteristic size of the grains is intermediate between that of
interstellar dust and dust in the old protoplanetary disk of {beta}
Pictoris. We assume on the basis of this analysis that RR Tau is
surrounded by a young protoplanetary disk and that it can be considered
as a young progenitor of {beta} Pictoris. }

Mie theory and Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory (MG-Mie) are
used to examine a ratio, beta, of the radiation pressure forces to
the gravity on porous aggregates with fractal structures, which
consist of absorbing or dielectric materials. A comparison of beta by
Mg-Mie theory with those computed by the discrete dipole
approximation (DDA) shows that when the dust aggregates have rather
compact structures and/or the constituent particles are absorbing
materials, the values of beta by DDA theory are reproduced reasonably
by MG-Mie theory. It is found that, the higher the porosity, the
smaller the value of beta becomes near the maximum of beta at a
characteristic radius of the aggregate of about 0.1 micron. For very
porous aggregates, beta does not depend on size in contrast to a
remarkable size dependence of beta for compact spheres.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The ongoing Galileo imaging of the Jovian system will provide an opportunity
to clarify the ring's radial and vertical structure, as well as the size
distribution of its constituents, each of which is poorly constrained by
Voyager images. Most models of the Jovian ring consider that electromagnetic
forces elevate micron-sized grains (which acquire charge from the ambient
plasma) out of the equatorial plane. These forces may explain one aspect of
the ring system that stands out clearly: the pronounced vertical flaring of
the ring in the halo region.

The current state of the observations is not sufficient to distinguish
between competing models, and thus we review the various mechanisms proposed
to date, highlighting their similarities and differences.

Here we use numerical orbit integrations over a range of particles sizes to
follow dust grains originating from the main ring as they evolve by plasma
drag through so-called Lorentz resonances. For a range of charge-to-mass
ratios and plasma drag rates, large jumps in inclination ensue; these jumps
occur near 1.7 and 1.4 R_J, where the vertical
thickness of the main ring increases by an order of magnitude to the halo,
and where the halo vanishes. This model does not depend strongly on plasma
measurements in the ring region: all that is required is some small charge
on grains, and any mechanism which gradually draws grains through the
resonance zones. From these integrations we produce ring cross-sections
which roughly match the halo slice data of Showalter et al.

As part of this study, we have simulated the trajectories of individual
particles having widely different charge-to-mass ratios. Not surprisingly,
very highly charged grains are closely tied to the magnetic field, while
large particles follow nearly Keplerian orbits. Intermediately charged
grains have significant excursions, some leaving the system altogether; this
occurs especially near Lorentz resonances. These characteristics seem to
provide the correct clay from which to mold the jovian ring's morphology.},

  { Recently released cometary particles are most likely aggregates
of core-mantle building blocks. Their structures are therefore porous
(fluffy particles). Lunar microcrater studies and in situ dust experiments
have shown that the majority of the interplanetary dust particles are
compact grains with densities between 3 and 8 g/cu cm, although 20 percent
of the interplanetary dust is of low density (less than 1 g/cu cm). Under
the assumption that cometary grains slowly lose their mantle material, the
grains become denser. Simultaneously the orbits also become more circular as
compared to the original cometary orbit. This has been observed by the
Helios dust experiment.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The meteoroid penetration detectors on Pioneer 10 (channel 0)
recorded 95 penetrations through the 25-micron stainless steel test
material while the spacecraft was between 1 and 18 AU. The spatial
density of 10 to the -9 g meteoroids is found to be essentially
constant between 1 and 18 AU. The meteoroid penetration detectors on
Pioneer 11 recorded 87 penetrations (55 on channel 0 and 32 on
channel 1) through the 50-micron stainless steel test material while
the spacecraft was between 1 and 9 AU. It is found that the
meteoroids between 4 and 5 AU are not in direct circular or
near-circular orbits near the ecliptic plane. The Pioneer 11 data
obtained between 4 and 5 AU are best explained by the meteoroids
being in randomly inclined orbits of high eccentricity. If meteoroids
are in these cometlike orbits, the great increase in penetration flux
previously measured near Jupiter with the Pioneer 10 experiment
cannot be attributed to gravitational focusing unless the size
distribution of meteoroids changes substantially between 1 and 5 AU.
At Saturn encounter, the penetration flux increased by about three
orders of magnitude, probably as the result of impacts from ring
particles. Saturn's ring E is estimated to be 1800 km thick with an
optical thickness greater than 10 to the -8.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
An extensive analysis of field emission effects on the electrostatic
breakup potential of lunar impact ejecta particles was conducted. It is
shown that the dominant factor in the determination of the equilibrium
potential of micron size particles in space is field emission. The
dynamics of particles reaching the magnetosphere was studied. The most
interesting region was the zone on the sunward side of the earth between L
values of 1.2 and 3.1. These minute particles may have residence times in
that zone that are considerably greater than that represented by
interplanetary dust flowing through the same region. The spatial densities
of lunar ejecta in these zones can be one to two orders of magnitude more
than that in interplanetary space for the same particle size regime.
However, significant permanent trapping is not found for these particle
regimes at this time.},

The micrometeoroid experiment onboard Helios allowed the measurement
of physical and chemical characteristics of interplanetary dust
particles between 0.3AU and 1AU solar distance. During the first 10
orbits of Helios 1,235 impacts of micrometeoroids were detected.
Eighty-three particles were registered by the ecliptic sensor and 152
by the south sensor. Most of the particles detected by the ecliptic
sensor impacted the sensor from the apex direction. The particles
observed by the south impacted the sensor from all directions with a
slightly enhanced flux from solar direction. The average of impact
speed of particles was 15 km/s. From 1AU to 0.3AU, the observed
particle flux increased by a factor 5 to 10. The orbits of the
registered particles are highly eccentric, e or approximately 0.6,
and some are hyperbolic. The mass spectra measured upon impact allow
the classification of the chondritic and iron rich particles.},

   found from calculations that predicted track densities for a particle of
   given size are related logarithmically to the minimum semimajor axis of
   the source body. Consequently, although track densities measurements may
   not be capable of distinguishing cometary from asteroidal sources, they
   should give information on the minimum semimajor axis of the originating

  ABSTRACT      = {
Theoretical models developed to explain the origin of solar-system
dust are examined critically on the basis of recent observational
data. Evidence from the exposure ages of stratospheric interplanetary
dust particles, the compressive strength of typical fireballs, and
observations of a broad ecliptic meteor stream (with numerous
short-lived meteoroid swarms) centered on the Taurids is summarized
and shown to favor a meteoroidal (rather than meteoritic) model of
the present zodiacal cloud. In this model, a large comet which
attained an earth-crossing orbit 10,000-100,000 yrs ago and is now
defunct produced the present cloud, but the cloud still contains a
large meteoroid capable of reactivation as a comet roughly every 1000
yrs. It is suggested that such a comet could bombard the earth with
meteoroids of mass 100 Gg or greater, perhaps explaining climate
changes and mass extinctions. An observation campaign to search for
the large meteoroid is proposed.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Simple dynamical models based on Opic's (1976) theory are used to judge
the relative probabilities of the evolutionary outcomes of a process in
which fragments from a catastrophic impact against Hyperion either
impacted Titan or spread into the inner part of the Saturnian system,
and contributed to the cratering record of the inner satellites. The
models indicate that the overwhelming majority of fragments were swept
up by Titan; the flux of impactors therefore declines rapidly inward,
and was low for all the inner satellites other than Rhea.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The present treatment of greater-than-1-mm particle-size
impact-ejecta dynamics for Phobos and Deimos considers only the
gravitational forces of Mars and its satellites and the centrifugal
and Coriolis forces. Attention is given to two major factors of major
significance for regolith formation: the escape probability from a
given surface site, and the probability of reimpact; both of these
functions vary significantly over the surfaces of the Martian
satellites. The escape-probability differences between adjoining
regions are greater for Phobos, although the reimpact probability
variations for both satellites are considerable. The density trends
are noted to become isotropic for greater launch velocities. While
the overall dust-particle density is estimated to be a few hundred
particles/cu km near the Phobos surface, the dust density around
Deimos is 2-3 times larger.},

accelerator. Silicate particles with masses between 10 to the minus
9th to minus 6th power g and speeds between 2 and 12 km/sec were shot
at the sensor. At constant speed a linear dependency between the
impact charge and the particle mass is found. The DIDSY-IPM
electronics has a nonlinear response to the impact charge. The
penetration limit for the three foil protective cover of the sensor
was determined. A penetration limit of 5 times 10 to the minus 10th
power g for silicate particles at 70 km/sec is derived.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Measurements of the densities of interplanetary dust particles and
unweathered stone meteorites indicate that both have significant porosity on
the microscopic scale. In addition, the chondritic stone meteorites are
generally inhomogeneous, typically consisting of strong, millimeter-size,
olivine chondrules embedded in a weaker, fine-grained matrix. Since target
porosity is known to influence energy partitioning in cratering and
disruption, we have begun a series of experiments to study the impact
disruption of inhomogeneous assemblages of two materials of different
strengths and which exhibit significant porosity. Experiments were performed
on three ~300-g targets of porphyritic olivine basalt, consisting of
millimeter-size olivine phenocrysts in a fine-grained vesicular matrix
(simulating a stone meteorite). Using the NASA Ames Vertical Gun, each
target was impacted by a 1/4-in. diameter aluminum sphere at a speed of ~5
km s-1. To avoid measuring the secondary effects of fragmentation caused by
material impacting on the walls of the gun chamber, we monitored primary
debris using passive detectors. We measured the size-frequency distribution
of the small fragments using thin foils. Most foils showed only small
depressions, sometimes containing fragments of debris, indicating relatively
low velocity debris. One foil showed ~300 puncture holes from high-speed
particles, presumably a localized jet or cone of target or projectile
ejecta. The size-frequency distribution was quite steep down to the ~10- to
20-&mu;m limit where particle size was comparable to foil thickness. Aerogel
cells were employed to capture dust-size primary debris. Using an in situ
chemical analysis technique, we distinguished matrix from olivine and
determined that fragments<100&mu;m in size were matrix while the majority of
the largest fragments (>200 &mu;m in size) were olivine. We also collected
the debris from the floor of the gun chamber. The largest fragments
(significantly bigger than individual olivine phenocrysts) were
representative of bulk target material. In the millimeter-size range we
found a large number of isolated olivine crystals, indicating the target
experienced preferential failure along the phenocryst-matrix boundaries. All
three shots showed distinct changes in the slopes of the mass-frequency
distribution near 0.4 g, the size of typical olivine phenocrysts. This
suggests that the mechanical failure of the material was affected by the
presence of the phenocrysts. If our results are directly applicable to
chondritic meteorites, then impact cratering and disruption of chondritic
asteroids may overproduce olivine-rich material from chondrules in the
millimeter-size range and olivine might be underrepresented at smaller sizes
in the primary debris.},

It is proposed that the moons, rings, and dust now visible in the
Uranus system are created by the diminution of larger objects by
meteoroid impacts. A Monte Carlo calculation shows that the largest
surviving fragments of the original precursor satellites are in the
size range of the new satellites observed by Voyager near the rings.
The current bombardment rate is sufficient to create all the observed
rings and dust bands.  The observed and inferred components of the
Uranus ring system fit a power-law size distribution with index of
about three. It is predicted that the material in Neptune's ring
system has a similar size distribution.},

  ABSTRACT      =
  {
One of the strangest satellites in the Solar System is Saturn's
tidally-locked Iapetus which has a bright white trailing hemisphere and a
jet-black leading face. It has long been suspected that dark dusty debris,
originating from Saturn's outermost satellite Phoebe and brought inward by
Poynting-Robertson drag, is responsible for Iapetus' striking albedo
asymmetry. The Phoebe-dust model is very compelling because it naturally
explains why the leading face of Iapetus, the side that is receiving dust
from Phoebe, is dark. The model has not gained universal acceptance,
however, primarily due to the following dynamical problems: i) the
distribution of dark material on Iapetus does not precisely match predicted
contours of constant dust flux from Phoebe, ii) there are dark-floored
craters in Iapetus' high-albedo hemisphere, and iii) Iapetus' North pole is
brighter than parts of the trailing hemisphere. These problems are greatly
reduced with the realization that Iapetus took nearly a billion years to
become tidally locked to Saturn.

I suggest the following scenario for the origin of the black/while dichotomy
on Iapetus. Phoebe was probably captured early in the Solar System's
history, well before Iapetus' spin slowed to its present synchronous rate.
While Iapetus was spinning rapidly, dust from Phoebe accumulated at all
longitudes on Iapetus uniformly. The accumulation was greatest near Iapetus'
equator and decreased with roughly a cosine dependence toward the poles
where the dust flux was lowest. After Iapetus became tidally locked, its
trailing side was shielded from Phoebe dust, and volatile ice accumulated
there burying the dark Phoebe material. Large impacts on the trailing side
have dredged up some ancient Phoebe debris, creating the dark-floored
craters. In addition, impacts have mixed dark debris with icy material,
thereby lowering the albedo of the trailing side. Iapetus' poles are the
brightest parts of the satellite simply because little Phoebe dust ever
accreted there. Since the distribution of Iapetus' dark material depends on
the flux of Phoebe dust over 4.5 billion years, it is not surprising that
the distribution does not precisely match predictions which consider only
the present dynamical configurations of the two satellites.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
From recent Galileo and Keck observations, Jupiter's outermost gossamer
rings seem to be collisional ejecta derived from the moons Amalthea and
Thebe, whose orbits circumscribe these very faint rings. The rings' visible
grains, which are small, evolve inward by Poynting-Robertson drag. The main
ring is probably debris from Adrastea, which skims along its periphery. The
loss of ejecta from these ring-moons is shown to be heavily influenced by
the satellites' size, shape, orbital radius and surface characteristics.
Recollision times into satellites are 500-10,000 yrs in the vertically
extended gossamer rings but only 20 years for the equatorially confined main
ring, accounting for the ring's relative faintness near Metis' path. Mutual
particle collisions are rare, allowing the use of single-particle dynamics.

Periodic electromagnetic forces, due to Jupiter's rotating magnetic field,
may resonate with the epicyclic frequencies of grains. Such a 3:2 ``Lorentz"
resonance lies just upstream of where the ring noticeably thickens, while
the 2:1 version may drive ring grains into Jupiter's atmosphere. An infinite
number of such resonances cluster about synchronous orbit, populating the
gossamer ring region. We show through numerical simulations that, for
sufficiently slow evolution, resonant trapping should be common. Jumps are
not seen in images, implying smaller charge-to-mass ratios than assumed or
inadequate image processing.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
It is shown that many of the observed properties of the Jovian ring
can be explained by the presence of numerious small and unseen parent
bodies, or 'mooms', residing within the ring; whose radii are less
than 1 km. The small visible ring grains, which are destroyed in
short times by sputtering and meteoroid erosion, are derived from
these parent bodies largely through meteoroid impacts, and partly
from Io's dust. Substantial orbit modification results from plasma
drag, and the charge carried by the grains will influence their
dynamics and may modify their shapes. It is concluded that the
processes discussed, though present in other planetary ring systems,
may be highlighted in Jupiter's ring because of its low optical depth
and the small size of some of its particles. It is suggested that
hidden reservoirs similar to the Jovian 'mooms' proposed may be
present in the rings of Saturn and Uranus.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The orbital dynamics of submicron size lunar ejecta trapped in the earth's
magnetosphere is analyzed in light of the enhanced fluxes of micron and
submicron particles measured by the HEOS II dust experiment.  Particle
sizes and regions within the magnetosphere in which electromagnetic forces
predominate over gravitational forces are calculated for particles assumed
to have a speed on the order of the escape velocity and potentials of 100
and 1000 V. Conditions under which the corotation of the earth's magnetic
field may be ignored and the guiding center approximation is valid are
also derived, along with the times required for a particle to acquire its
full charge. Results demonstrate that pronounced stratification of lunar
ejecta according to particle size could take place in a quiet
magnetosphere, accounting for the swarms observed by HEOS II.},

Results are summarized for a study of plasma-sheet particles (and their
flow) encountered by the moon during its passage through the geomagnetic
tail. The study is based on analysis of data obtained with a modulated
Faraday cup on board the lunar-anchored spacecraft Explorer 35. It is
shown that the electrons have a rapidly fluctuating non-Maxwellian energy
distribution with a mean energy of several hundred electron volts and a
density of approximately 0.2 per cu cm. Protons with energies of the order
of 1 keV were usually detected above the instrument background when
flowing towards earth at about 200 km/sec. It is suggested that strong
terrestrial polar winds during the early history of the earth-moon system
could have caused some erosion of the front side of the moon and that the
relative smoothness of the same side could be explained in terms of
gravitational shielding by the earth from the interplanetary rock flux.},

The observation of the Frauenhofer corona (F corona) is discussed. It
provides the opportunity for studying the annihilation and creation of
dust within circumstellar dust clouds. The specific patterns of
scattering light and thermal radiation in the infrared, are studied. A
spaceborne remote sensing experiment regarding the radiation properties
of dust, in the visible for scattered sunlight, and in the infrared for
the thermal emission of grains, is effectuated. It allows the analysis
of this complex scenario. A rocketborne twin coronagraph is shown to be
needed.},

The dust and gas environment in the vicinity of the orbit of the

stable ring of dust particles with radii of about 100 microns could
exist with a normal optical depth close to the upper limit determined
from the Viking Orbiter 1 mission. The presence of a gas ring with
neutral number density substantially higher than the hot atomic
oxygen background is possible only if the Phobos moon maintains a
certain level of outgassing.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Perturbations of hydrogen atoms in Keplerian orbits are examined by
analyzing the rates of change of the classical orbital elements.
There are three main effects: high inclination orbits with
eccentricities e at least 0.4 are forced toward the ecliptic plane
within a few weeks, the perigees of direct orbits drift rapidly
toward stable positions roughly westward of the planet, and satellite
orbits in or near such a stable point rapidly lower their perigees
and the satellite's life is ended by a collision in the atmosphere.
Thus there are effects tending to diminish the number of highly
eccentric orbits with distant apogees in six principal directions.
The various lifetimes are compared for a sample of initial elements.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The effects of radiation forces on a grain in planetary orbit are
examined with particular emphasis on implications for planetary
rings. The origin of radiation forces is briefly considered mainly to
provide order of magnitude. The secular changes of orbital elements
are derived and the effects of the planetary shadow assessed. We show
that this shadow is of little importance in the dynamics of planetary
rings, yielding but a small periodic oscillation in the semimajor
axis. The periodical evolution of the other orbital elements is
investigated, both for a spherical and for an oblate planet. We
demonstrate the existence of a forced eccentricity that is strongly
enhanced at a particular critical distance where resonance occurs. In
the case of Saturn this critical distance is nearly coincident with
the outer boundary of the E ring, involving a depletion in very small
particles.},

Between about 80 and 200 AU from the star, the Beta Pictoris disk has a
growing geometrical thickness (opening angle of about 7 deg), and a
normal thickness falling off as r exp -1.7, approximately. Closer to the
star, the power-law breaks down, and the disk has a central void within
the 10 to 20 AU radius circle. Disk grains, most of them in the 1 to 20
micron size-range, scatter visible starlight neutrally with a high
albedo of 0.6 to 0.8, yet they are inefficient IR-emitters. Plausible
grain compositions include either fine-grained feldspars or olivines or,
alternatively, water and/or ammonia frost with a small amount of
contaminants. },

  ABSTRACT      = {
We have evaluated the spatial distribution of dust in disks supplied by
colliding or evaporating bodies spread in a small belt. The gradient of
the distribution of dust expelled by radiation pressure is generally
steeper than the one observed around {beta} Pictoris. It follows that,
to generate the {beta} Pictoris disk distribution in such a way, one
should extract relatively more small particles in the production
process: thanks to radiation forces, these smaller particles have large
eccentricities and thus could be seen at very large distances from their
injection place. The evaporation process of comet-like bodies moving
slowly inwards may yield the necessary particle size distribution. It is
interesting to note that this dynamical description is able to account
for the main observational properties of the {beta} Pictoris disk, such
as the power law distribution with possibly a change in slope, the
asymmetry at large distances, and the total mass, all of which have

Existence and stability of equilibrium points for particles moving in
the vicinity of two massive bodies which exert light radiation are
studied numerically. The dynamical system formed is described by means of
the photogravitational circular restricted three-body model which
includes the relativistic components of the radiation force constituting
the Poynting-Robertson effect. The differential equations
expressing this model are presented. The relations determining the
positions of the coplanar equilibrium points, as well as the linear system
governing their stability are produced and studied numerically. The
results are discussed and presented in graphical and tabular form.},

  ABSTRACT        = {
Data of Pioneer 10 meteoroid penetration detectors were revised
taking into account the orientation of detectors and the spacecraft
velocity relative to the sporadic meteor flux. The meteor flux
density increases as an exponent to the orbit of Mars for two times
for the particles with masses greater than 10(exp -6) g and six times
for the particles with masses greater than 10(exp -12) - 10(exp -9) g
then decreases after the orbit.  Ejections of secondary meteoroid
particles from surfaces of Phobos and Deimos are a possible
explanation for the increase in meteoroid flux.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The sublimation of interplanetary dust grains in the vicinity of the Sun
was considered, especially as a possible source of beta meteoroids. Data
from the HELIOS 1 and 2 micrometeoroid detectors (E 10) were
interpreted. To determine the sublimation rates, the energy balance of a
grain was evaluated for interaction with the solar radiation field, with
solar wind particles, and with solar energetic particles. Compared to
the energy transfered through interaction with the solar radiation
field, all other processes were negligible for the determination of the
temperature distribution. The only exception was water ice particles.
The equation of motion for the dust particles was numerically solved
with regard to the forces of interaction with the solar electromagnetic
radiation field. Depending on the material and sizes, the orbits of the
particles stabilize at different heliocentric distances. The inward
spiraling due to the Poynting-Robertson effect ends by the total
evaporation of the particles in the stability region.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The evidence from the geological and biological history of the earth,
from the morphology of the inner-planet surfaces, and from the orbits
of asteroids which supports the hypothesis (originally proposed by
Lyttleton, 1951) that the comet cloud of the solar system was
captured from Galactic molecular clouds much more recently than 4.5
Gyr ago, is nonthermalized, contains about 10 to the 7th objects, and
is summarized. The basic tenets of the generally accepted Oort-cloud
theory are reviewed; the periodicity of the terrestrial and planetary
record is described; and the distribution and atomic composition of
comets in the giant molecular clouds through which the solar system
passes every 100-200 Myr is evaluated. Consideration is given to the
implications of this hypothesis for star-formation models, and it is
suggested that external compression (density waves or supernova
shocks) produces nonvirialized bodies which then undergo Jeans
instability and condense to comet families with the potential to
aggregate and evolve into stars.},

collision - below a certain limit where the orbits cannot overlap.
  From these simple arguments Laskar derived final distribution of orbits $a$ if

  ABSTRACT      = {
The parameters of the best-fitting ellipsoid have been derived using the
latest spherical harmonics of the Phobos topography (Duxbury, 1989) by
solution of nonlinear overdetermined inverse problem. The lengths of the
equatorial axes of the ellipsoid have been determined (a = 12.9 km, b = 11.4
km). They are nearly the same as established by Duxbury on the basis of the
linearized relationship between the squared lenghts of ellipsoidal axes and
the topography coefficients C(20) and C(22). The length of the polar axis (c
= 9.1 km) differs by about 20 percent from Duxbury's value. Supposing mass
homogeneity of Phobos, the Stokes parameters of the external gravitational
field have been derived up to those of the sixth degree and order. The large
irregularities in the Phobos figure cause the values of the Duxbury's
potential coefficients be fairly inaccurate except the harmonics C(20),
C(32), and S(51), i.e., linearized relationship between gravity and
topography cannot be applied for Phobos. Finally, positions of the center of
figure and the directions of the principal axes of inertia have been
established.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The Jovian satellites and ring are continuously bombarded by high-energy
galactic cosmic rays and magnetospheric ions. Nuclear interactions will
create very energetic neutrons and pions. The decay of some of these
unstable particles within the Jovian magnetosphere will result in
trapped protons and ultrarelativistic electrons and positrons. Although
this source is weak compared to those that yield lower-energy
magnetospheric particles, it is expected to generate the most energetic
Jovian particles. These processes are briefly described.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
A marked dichotomy in the density distribution of the Uranian
satellites has been observed. The densities of Ariel and Umbriel are
similar to those of the inner satellites of Saturn, and are
consistent with a composition of 40 percent rock and 60 percent water
ice, while Titania and Oberon appears to have much higher densities.
It is argued here that the problem posed by this density distribution
arises from a misunderstanding of the orbital dynamics and may be
imaginary. It is also shown that the observed eccentricities of the
inner satellites, Ariel and Miranda, may be partly forced by the
outer satellites, and that these forced eccentricities may be
maintained despite strong tidal damping.},

The pseudo-Poynting-Robertson effect on an interplanetary grain due
to solar wind bombardments is examined with careful consideration for
sputtering of a grain and for the velocity dispersion of the solar
wind particles. It is found that for water-ice and obsidian grains
with radii in the range 0.01-100 micrometers, the retarding force due
to solar wind is stronger than, and of the same order as,
respectively, that due to solar radiation. On the other hand, for
magnetite this drag force is always less than that due to solar
radiation. In addition, since the wind flow generally comes from the
east of the sun, a grain in a prograde orbit suffers a larger
retarding force compared with a grain in a retrograde orbit.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The possibility that the peculiar orbital motion of Hyperion,
characterized by a strong orbit-orbit resonance with the neighboring
Titan, was responsible for Hyperion's failure to reaccrete fragments
after its collisional disruption is investigated. Numerical experiments
performed to explore the region of the phase space surrounding the
present orbit show that most fragments ejected with a relative velocity
greater than about 0.1 km/s rapidly attain chaotic orbits with repeated
close encounters with Titan. Ejection velocities of this order of
magnitude are expected for collisions of about 10 km/sec with a
projectile-to-target mass ratio of the order of 10 to the -3. Such
events are not likely to displace the largest remnant (i.e., the present
Hyperion) outside the stable region of the phase space associated with
the resonance, but could be responsible for the large amplitude of the
observed orbital libration.},

The photogravitational circular restricted three-body model including
the Poynting-Robertson effect is employed to describe the motion of a
particle in the vicinity of two massive radiating bodies. The equilibrium
points lying out of the orbital plane of the primaries are studied
numerically. The exact number of these points is determined by
means of the topological degree theory. Subsequently, a modified
bisection method is used to compute the positions of the equilibrium.
Finally their stability is studied.},

    Abstract = {
The extinction curves arising from the combined effect of absorption and
scattering of stellar radiation in dust shells around pre-main-sequence
stars have been investigated. Monte Carlo simulations of the polarized
radiation transfer in an inhomogeneous spheroidal shell have been used
to determine the scattered radiation. The results are presented as the
normalized curves for circumstellar extinction A({lambda})-A(0.3{mu}m)
in the wavelength range from 0.1{mu}m to 1{mu}m. The dependence of these
curves on the parameters of silicate-graphite dust mixture and the shell
shape, orientation and structure is examined. It is found that the
circumstellar extinction of disk-like shells seen pole-on is the most
influenced by scattered radiation that leads to the flattening of the
extinction curves. Variations of the dust grains and dust shell
parameters can produce similar effects on the extinction curves which
are difficult to distinguish from each other. Then, the wavelength
dependence of polarization can be used to estimate the properties of
circumstellar shells. Our theoretical models are used to interpret the
observations of the extinction in the ultraviolet and visual, and the
visual polarization of three Herbig Ae/Be stars: AB Aur, HD 259431 and
HD 200775. We found that the minimum size of grains is >0.01{mu}m. The
slope of the grain size spectrum changes in the interval from 3.2 to
5.0. In the shells around AB Aur and HD 200775, there is an excess and a
depletion of silicate particles, respectively. The shell aspect ratio
varies from 2.0 (AB Aur) to 5.0 (HD 200775). Apparently, the dust shell
of AB Aur is seen nearly to pole-on (i=~30deg), while the other two
stars approximately edge-on. }

  ABSTRACT      = {
The present study has the objective to reevaluate the size
distribution of interplanetary meteoroids on the basis of the most
recent data, and to analyze the probable nature of the sinks and
sources of meteoritic material. The flux of interplanetary meteorites
at 1 AU is discussed, taking into account general characteristics,
lunar crater distribution, flux curves, spatial densities, and
cross-sectional distribution and light scattering. Collisional
effects are examined, giving attention to catastrophic collisions,
collision rate, and destroyed mass and generated fragments. The
effect of radiation pressure on small particles is considered along
with the difference between the lunar and interplanetary flux models,
collisional evolution at 1 AU, potential sources for large
meteoroids, and observational evidence of losses of small
micrometeoroids.},

The results of Pioneer 10/11 observations of the interplanetary dust
environment beyond 1 AU, and near the ringed planets are reviewed. It
is suggested that the cometary core/mantle grain model of Greenberg
(1983) can account for the apparent contradiction between the results
of two Pioneer experiments: the penetration experiment; and the
optical experiment. It is also suggested that the observed
enhancements of the interplanetary dust flux by 1-2 orders of
magnitude near Jupiter and Saturn may have been caused by the
following factors: gravitational focussing; ejecta from
Jovian/Saturnian satellites; or electrostatic fragmentation products.},

An analytical and numerical investigation is conducted of the motions

the influence of the Saturn oblate gravity field, solar radiation
pressure, and EM forces. By plotting the position of a single
particle over time, the distribution of 1-micron rains thus injected
is shown in the course of swift movement under these forces; the
distribution is noted to exhibit many of the characteristics of the
Saturn E ring. Particles with slightly different grain sizes are
found to achieve much smaller eccentricities.},

From a statistical analysis of asteroid orbital period data, it is
shown that the present distribution of asteroids is strongly
correlated with the present orbital period of Jupiter (to 1 part in
5000). By analyzing the distribution of orbital eccentricities and
inclinations it is shown that the resonant structure of the belt was
formed after the asteroids dispersed from the near-coplanar disk in
which they accreted.},

A general solution is obtained for the angular distribution of the
intensity and velocity of interplanetary projectiles impinging on a
planetary ring system. Three significant results emerge from the
solution: (1) a variation with orbital longitude is demonstrated in
the impact velocity-weighted impact rate of the planetary rings'
cometary meteoroids; (2) the angular distribution of ejecta intensity
due to the bombardment of a planetary ring by interplanetary
meteoroids is determined; and (3) the radial drift velocity due to
both simple mass-loading and aberration-induced asymmetry in the
impact rate is calculated for a planetary ring of arbitrary optical
depth. Attention is given to results for projectiles with Oort
Cloud-type orbits.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
On 21 November 1995, Saturn and its rings occulted the star GSC5249-01240
(Bosh & McDonald 1992, Astron. J. 103, 983). Although the star is relatively
faint (V = 11.9), other circumstances conspired to make this an excellent
event: (i) the normally-bright rings were dark because the sun was crossing
through the ring plane, reducing the amount of ring contribution to the
background noise and therefore increasing the observed S/N, (ii) the ring
opening angle was small (B ~ 3 degrees), enhancing detection
of low-optical-depth material, and (iii) the low sky-plane velocity allowed
longer integration times without loss of spatial resolution. Thus this
occultation was particularly well-suited to produce high S/N detections of
low- tau ring material.

We observed this atmosphere and ring occultation with the Faint Object
Spectrograph (FOS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. Using the FOS in its
high-speed mode, we sampled the starlight with the G650L grating, recording
the stellar signal as a function of both wavelength and time. For the
initial analysis of these data, the spectral information was sacrificed by
binning all wavelengths together; this in turn increased the detected S/N.
We performed a geometric solution for the event, using the known locations
of circular ring features as fiducials (Elliot et al., Astron. J. 106,
2544). The scattered light from Saturn and the rings was modelled and
subtracted from the light curves to obtain line-of-sight optical depth as a
function of ring-plane radius.

With these processed data we have made the first occultation detection of
Saturn's innermost and very tenuous D ring. We find a line-of-sight optical
depth for the thickest part of this ring of tau_obs ~ 0.02. The
location and morphology of this feature will be discussed. Comparison of the
observed structure will be made with the previous Voyager imaging detection
of this ring (Smith et al. 1981, Science 212, 163; Marley & Porco 1993,
Icarus 106, 508).},

Evidence for a moonlet belt in the region between Saturn's close-in
moonrings Pandora and Prometheus is discussed. It is argued that
little-known observations of magnetospheric electron density by
Pioneer 11 imply substantial, ongoing injections of mass into the
2000 km region which surrounds the F ring. A hypothesis is presented
that these events result naturally from interparticle collisions
between the smaller members of an optically thin belt of moonlets.
Also discussed is work on Uranus ring structure and photometry, image
processing and analysis of the Jonian ring strucure, photometric and
structural studies of the A ring of Saturn, and improvements to an
image processing system for ring studies.},

It is proposed that charged particles from the Jovian magnetosphere,
contaminants such as sulfur from Io, and high-velocity micrometeoritic
matter, combine to darken, redden, and alter the surface of Amalthea
revealed by Voyager; whose few isolated bright spots have a distinct
greenish spectrum. A major finding of this analysis is that available
spectral reflectance data contain little information about the bulk
composition of the satellite. The effects of contamination by sulfur and
its allotropes are shown to redden a variety of bulk compositions:
carbonaceous material, refractory minerals, iron and iron sulfides, and
moderate temperature silicates. The bright, greenish spots probably
identify locations in which atypical alteration processes occur, such as
variations in the amount of contaminant sulfur in micrometeoritic
glasses or in the relative abundances of certain sulfur allotropes.},

The ground-based stellar occultation observations presently analyzed
furnish evidence for either incomplete or highly inhomogeneous
ring-like material around Neptune, as well as an upper limit for the
density of continuous rings of the planet. The analysis shows that
the June 22, 1984 and August 20, 1985 observations of material around
Neptune are probably due to highly inhomogeneous ring-like material,
or arcs, orbiting the planet. The extant data are also studied for
narrow (10-50 km) continuous rings; no evidence is found for them
between 1.1 and 3.5 Neptunian radii; neither are there diffuse rings
near the 53,200 and 63,000 km radii where Voyager 2 observed two
continuous rings.},

Exospheric theory is reformulated to provide for the analysis of
dynamical underpinning of exospheric features. The formulation is
based on the parabolic-cylindrical separability of the Hamiltonian
that describes particle motions in the combined fields of planetary
gravity and solar radiation pressure. An approximate solution for
trajectory evolution in terms of orbital elements is derived and the
role of the exopause in the tail phenomenon is discussed. Also, an
expression is obtained for the bound constituent atom densities at
outer planetocoronal positions along the planet-sun axis for the case
of an evaporative, uniform exobase. This expression is used to
estimate midnight density enhancements as a function of radial
distance for the terrestrial planets.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
There are several observations showing an enhancement of infrared
emission and optical polarization at a distance of 4 solar radii,
implying a ring of dust in near-ecliptic orbit about the sun, but there
is an almost equal number of observations which do not show any such
enhancement. We plotted the observational results for the detection and
the nondetection of the circumsolar dust on a diagram for the variation
of the sunspot number with time, and found that its detection and
nondetection occurred near the solar minimum and maximum phases,
respectively. We present the possibility that this phenomenon is caused
by an additional process, i.e., the Lorentz force acting on a charged
dust particle. Since at the maximum phase a dust particle in a
near-solar region acquires a higher positive potential and the solar
magnetic field is very strong, the Lorentz force becomes dominant and
can affect the orbit of the dust particle.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The origin of the newly discovered narrow ring systems around
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus is considered. It is pointed out that both
the Uranian and Jovian ring systems have mean orbital radii of 1.8
planetary radii and lie within the Roche zones of their respective
planets, and it is suggested that the Jovian ring is the product of
the disintegration of a satellite that entered the Roche zone, and
that large numbers of small particles are now in horseshoe orbits
about the Lagrangian equilibrium points of the remnant chunks.
Analysis of the path of a ring particle in a horseshoe orbit is shown
to result in ring structures in agreement with those observed for the
circular rings of Jupiter and the highly eccentric ring of Uranus.
The stability of these ring systems is then considered, and it is
suggested that the F ring of Saturn, which lies outside the Roche
zone, represents primordial matter not yet accreted by small
satellites just inside the Mimas first-order resonances.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The problem of electromagnetic perturbations of charged dust particle
orbits in interplanetary space was reexamined in the light of the
large scale spatial and temporal interplanetary plasma and field
topology. Using analytical and numerical solutions for particle
propagation it was shown that: (1) stochastic variations induced by
electromagnetic forces are unimportant for the zodiacal dust cloud
except for the lowest masses, (2) systematic variations in orbit
inclinations are unimportant if orbital radii are larger than 10
A.U., (3) systematic variations in orbital parameters induced by
electromagnetic forces tend to shift the plane of symmetry of the
zodiacal dust cloud towards the solar magnetic equatorial plane, and
(4) inside 0.3 A.U. it is possible that dust particles may enter a
region of magnetically resonant orbits for some time. It is concluded
that numerical orbit calculation of dust particles show that one of
the results of interaction of charged particles with the
interplanetary magnetic field is the rotation of the orbit plane
about the solar rotational axis.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
A general model is developed for the quasi-periodic optical depth
fluctuations observed in photopolarimeter and radio occultation
profiles near the Encke Gap of Saturn's rings, which may be the
gravitational 'wakes' of a moonlet orbiting within the same gap. The
results obtained are used to estimate the moonlet's orbit and mass
from the occultation data. In view of the present treatment's neglect
of particle collisions and self-gravity, the longitude is consistent
with other estimates based on a photopolarimeter scan exterior to the
gap. The consistency of the orbit parameters inferred from
photopolarimeter, radio, and wavy edge data strongly suggests that a
single, dominant moonlet orbits within the gap.},

In order to determine whether the solar magnetic field can align

(1984), the solar magnetic fields is divided into its various multipole
components and theoretical expressions are derived to determine the
effect of each of these components on the orbital elements of
circumsolar dust. Simulations are then carried out to determine the
effect of a dynamic solar magnetic field on such particles using actual
values of the solar magnetic field supplied by Hoeksema (1984). These
results are compared to observations of the F corona.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
Recent studies of the lunar ejecta from lunar impacts of interplanetary
dust particles indicate that during favorable lunar phases, over 80% of
the submicron ejecta enters the earth's magnetosphere. This 'pulse' of
lunar ejecta produced by the sporadic meteor background will follow the
random variations of the sporadic flux. An additional enhancement of this
flux can be related to major meteor showers. Since the annual periods of
these showers occur during varying lunar phase angles, magnetosphere
ejecta flux associated with major showers will vary depending on the
coincidence of shower periods and favorable lunar phase angles. The
results of an analysis of the 'pulse' of ejecta flux in the magnetosphere
during the Quadrantids, Geminids, Leonids, and Perseids meteor showers are
presented. These results are compared to the satellite measurements of
1959 Eta and HEOS II.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The possibility is considered that a number of solar mass-loss events
were involved in the origin of the cloud of comets that appears to
surround the solar system. An analysis is performed which shows that
some multiple set of events would have made it moderately likely for
the solar system to be equipped with an Oort cloud and that the
average statistics are much more favorable for setting up the Oort
cloud by several events than by a single event. The effect of two
mass-loss events is examined, and it is found that the initial mass
of the solar disk would have to have been at least about 0.004 solar
mass if the Oort cloud was formed by just two such events.}

  ABSTRACT      = {
It is proposed that considerable care is required to properly
interpret either spacecraft in situ data or lunar crater data as well
as near-earth data; in the case of the former, complications may
arise which may be attributed to secondary lunar ejecta impacts, in
the latter, they may result from impacting earth-orbiting debris.
Experimental evidence suggests that most impact pits on lunar rocks
with pit diameters smaller than 7 micrometers have been generated by
lunar secondary ejecta impacts and not by primary meteoroid impacts.
It is also found that lunar crater production rates are more accurate
when deduced from meteoroid space experiments and not from solar
flare track ages. It is concluded that in so far as all of the above
qualifications are taken into account, a self-consistent meteoroid
flux versus mass distribution is obtained.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
We address compositional evolution in planetary ring systems subsequent to
meteoroid bombardment. The huge surface area to mass ratio of planetary
rings ensures the importance of this process, given currently expected
values of meteoroid flux. We developed a model which includes both direct
deposition of extrinsic meteoritic ``pollutants", and ballistic transport of
the increasingly polluted ring material as impact ejecta. Certain aspects of
the observed regional variations in ring color and albedo can be understood
in terms of such a process.

We conclude that the regional scale color and albedo differences between the
C ring and B ring can be understood if all ring material began with the same
composition (primarily water ice, based on other data, but colored by tiny
amounts of non-icy, reddish absorber) and then evolved entirely by addition
and mixing of extrinsic, neutrally colored, highly absorbing material. This
conclusion is readily extended to the Cassini Division and its surroundings
as well. Typical silicates are unable to satisfy the ring color,
spectroscopic, and microwave absorption constraints either as intrinsic or
extrinsic nonicy constituents. However, ``Titan Tholin" provides a
satisfactory match for the inferred refractive indices of the
``pre-pollution" nonicy ring material. The extrinsic bombarding material is
compatible with the properties of Halley or Chiron, but not with the
properties of other ``red" primitive objects such as Pholus.

We further demonstrate that the detailed radial profile of color across the
abrupt B ring - C ring boundary is quite compatible with such a ``pollution
transport" process, and that the shape of the profile can constrain key
parameters in the model. We use the model to estimate the ``exposure age" of
Saturn's rings to extrinsic meteoroid flux. We obtain a geologically young
``age" which is compatible with timescales estimated independently based on
the evolution of ring structure due to ballistic transport, and also with
other ``short timescales" estimated on the grounds of gravitational torques.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
   Observations of the total and polarized brightness of the solar corona
   at wavelength 2.12 microns during the total solar eclipse of 1991 July
   11 are employed to separate the contribution of the electron-scattered
   component and the remaining, nonpolarized component, the latter
   dominating in the outer corona. After corrections are applied to account
   for a two-component sky or instrument background, the brightness of the
   ecliptic and polar corona are fitted by r(exp -1.9) and r(exp -2.3),
   respectively, over the radial distance range 3-8 solar radii from Sun
   center. The ecliptic outer-coronal brightness is compared with a
   Mie-scattering model of interplanetary dust particles based upon three
   particle-size distributions deduced from, respectively, lunar
   microcrater counts (Lamy & Perrin 1986), interplanetary dust flux
   measurements (Gr\"un et al. 1985), and for an arbitrary population of
   large particles (radii greater than 3 x 10(exp -5) cm). Particle
   physical characteristics and spatial distributions are those assumed in
   past studies of the zodiacal cloud. For reasonable assumed space number
   densities of particles, the models agree with the magnitude of observed
   ecliptic coronal brightness. But in all cases, the models predict a
   steeper brightness falloff with radial distance that that observed, with
   those models for which the power-law exponent for the space distribution
   is v = 1.3 being the most discrepant with the observed radial gradient.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
We have revisited the problems related to the orbital dynamics of small
dust particles around Mars., that are continuously produced due to the
ongoing micrometeoroid bombardment of the moons Phobos and Deimos. In
our earlier studies we have examined the effects of electromagnetic
perturbations on micron sized dust grains and also the dynamics of
bigger particles and showed that grains with radius alpha ~ 10
micrometers from Deimos will dominate the dust population of the torus.
In these studies we have added several new effects. Now we properly
account for the orbital motion, obliquity and most importantly the
oblateness of Mars. First we will discuss our new analytic solution to
the orbit averaged perturbation equations that is valid for arbitrary
large eccentricities in the case of uninclined orbits and show the
unexpected role planetary oblateness might play by splitting up the
usual orbital periods. We will also show our computer simulation
results. We have found that the strong coupling between the orbital
inclination i, and the ascending node omega, will result in a
permanently tilted dust torus. This torus is azimuthally symmetric about
a tilted axis. The tilt angle of this axis is about 10 degrees and it
lies in the plane that is spanned by the celestial north and the spin
axis of Mars. The maximum 'edge-on' optical depth of the torus is tau ~
2 X 10^-7, that is comparable to the ethereal E-ring of Saturn and the
'gossamer' ring of Jupiter.},

and the electromagnetic (EM) force due to motion through the intense jovian
magnetic field. Large (micron-sized) grains are gravity-dominated and follow
nearly circular orbits around Jupiter, while very small (nanometer-sized)
grains are EM-dominated and gyrate about magnetic field lines; both are
tightly bound to Jupiter. Interestingly, intermediate (submicron-sized)
positively-charged dust grains are rapidly accelerated away from Jupiter to
form dust streams. Here we present numerical integrations that show that
negatively-charged submicron-sized grains remain bound to Jupiter
indefinitely for a rotationally symmetric magnetic field, but for timescales
of only months to years for the actual configuration of the jovian field.
This result has a number of interesting implications.

First, since submicron-sized dust grains launched from Io become
negatively-charged in Io's plasma torus, they remain bound in the torus for
several months and have time to spread into a ring. In addition, much of the
temporarily-trapped dust recollides with Io at high velocities (since the
dust is strongly accelerated by EM-forces). This leads to more ejecta and,
very possibly, a collisionally self-sustained population of dust. Our
results also indicate that positively-charged submicron-sized dust escaping
from the jovian Gossamer ring, can penetrate through the Io torus (in
addition to flying over and under it). Most of these submicron particles
eventually reach interplanetary space where they have been detected by the
Ulysses and Galileo spacecraft.

Rings of material should not form around Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto
since the positively-charged dust expected outside the Io torus is rapidly
accelerated away from Jupiter. But all of the Galilean satellites intercept
high velocity grains from the inner jovian system (and from interplanetary
and interstellar space) and effectively magnify the near-moon number
densities via the production of collisional ejecta. We predict that Galileo
will see a significant enhancement in the dust flux within a few radii of
each of the Galilean satellites due to collisional production of submicron
dust.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
We have now analyzed a substantial fraction of the IRAS observations
of the zodiacal cloud, particularly in the 25 micron waveband. We
have developed a gravitational perturbation theory that incorporates
the effects of Poynting-Robertson light drag (Gomes and Dermott,
1992). We have also developed a numerical model, the SIMUL mode, that
reproduces the exact viewing geometry of the IRAS telescope and
calculates the distribution of thermal flux produced by any
particular distribution of dust particle orbits (Dermott and
Nicholson, 1989). With these tools, and using a distribution of
orbits based on those of asteroidal particles with 3.4 micron radii
whose orbits decay due to Poynting-Robertson light drag and are
perturbed by the planets, we have been able to: (1) account for the
inclination and node of the background zodiacal cloud observed by
IRAS in the 25 micron waveband; (2) relate the distribution of orbits
in the Hirayama asteroid families to the observed shapes of the IRAS
solar system dustbands; and (3) show that there is observational
evidence in the IRAS data for the transport of asteroidal particles
from the main belt to the Earth by Poynting-Robertson light drag.},

  ABSTRACT      = {
The dynamics of a weakly charged dust grain orbiting in the
equatorial plane of a planet surrounded by a rigidly corotating
magnetospehre is examined. It is shown that an introduction of an
effectilve 1D potential causes a perturbation due to electrostatic
forces, which induces a motion of the pericenter, similar to the
effect of the planetary oblateness. A case is examined where the
charge varies periodically due to the modulation of the photoelectron
current occurring as the grain enters and leaves the planetary
shadow, causing the electromagnetic perturbation to resonate with the
orbital period and to modify the size and eccentricity of the orbit.
This effect is demonstrated both numerically and analytically for
small grains comprising the Jovian ring, showing that their resulting
changes are periodic, and their amplitude is much larger than that of
the periodic changes due to light-pressure perturbation or the
secular changes due to resonant charge variations that develop over a
comparable time span.},
