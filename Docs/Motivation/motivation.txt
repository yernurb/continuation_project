Dear expert committee


with this letter, I would like to express my interest in applying for the completion scholarship program, in order

to finish my Ph.D. in physics at the University of Potsdam.

Since my very childhood, Iâ€™ve always dreamed of becoming a physicist, and pursue a scientific career.


To achieve this goal, I studied physics at the Kazakh National University,

the best option I had available to me at the time. After graduation with excellence, I was fortunate enough to get acquainted with Prof. Arkadi Pikovsky and Prof. Michael Rosenblum and had a chance to work with them at the University of Potsdam.

It was a fruitful collaboration where I studied the behavior of oscillator ensembles with nonlinear coupling and as a result, we published two articles together. However, during these years of common work, I understood that I still need to learn a lot.


That is where I got introduced to Prof. Frank Spahn. I was always interested in two fields, cosmic exploration, and systems with a huge number of interacting objects. These two fields perfectly merged in the topic of research of Prof. Frank Spahn,

planetary rings, and cosmic dust research. He was very kind to accept me as a part of their group, where I started researching new and fascinating subjects, such as kinetics, granular gases, and orbital motion of bodies.

It was a long journey, but finally, after accumulating a certain level of knowledge, with the help of Prof. Frank Spahn and his group members, it became possible to develop some of my ideas into a publishable state. 


This is why I am writing this letter, to ask the expert committee to give me a chance to finish the work I have done with Prof. Frank Spahn, publish the results and write my Ph.D. thesis.


Yours sincerely,

Yernur Baibolatov
